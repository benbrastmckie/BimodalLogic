# Axioms - TM Axiom Schemata

This module defines the 21 axiom schemata for bimodal logic TM (Tense and Modality).

## Main Definitions

- `Axiom`: Inductive type characterizing valid axiom instances
- 21 axiom constructors organized into three categories:
  - **Base axioms** (17): Valid on all linear orders (no special frame conditions)
  - **Dense extension** (1): `density` - requires DenselyOrdered
  - **Discrete extension** (3): `discreteness_forward`, `seriality_future`, `seriality_past` - require SuccOrder/NoMaxOrder/NoMinOrder

## Axiom Constructors

- Base: `prop_k`, `prop_s`, `ex_falso`, `peirce`, `modal_t`, `modal_4`, `modal_b`,
  `modal_5_collapse`, `modal_k_dist`, `temp_k_dist`, `temp_4`, `temp_a`, `temp_l`,
  `temp_t_future`, `temp_t_past`, `modal_future`, `temp_future`, `temp_linearity`
- Dense: `density`
- Discrete: `discreteness_forward`, `seriality_future`, `seriality_past`

## Axiom Schemata

The TM logic includes:

### Propositional Axioms
- **K** (Propositional K): `(φ → (ψ → χ)) → ((φ → ψ) → (φ → χ))` - distribution axiom
- **S** (Propositional S): `φ → (ψ → φ)` - weakening axiom
- **EFQ** (Ex Falso Quodlibet): `⊥ → φ` - from absurdity, anything follows
- **Peirce** (Peirce's Law): `((φ → ψ) → φ) → φ` - classical implication principle

**Note**: Double Negation Elimination (`¬¬φ → φ`) is derivable from EFQ + Peirce
(see `Bimodal.Theorems.Propositional.double_negation`).

### S5 Modal Axioms (metaphysical necessity □)
- **MT** (Modal T): `□φ → φ` - what is necessary is true (reflexivity)
- **M4** (Modal 4): `□φ → □□φ` - necessary truths are necessarily necessary (transitivity)
- **MB** (Modal B): `φ → □◇φ` - truths are necessarily possible (symmetry)
- **MK** (Modal K Distribution): `□(φ → ψ) → (□φ → □ψ)` - necessity distributes over implication

### Temporal Axioms (future G, past H)
- **TK** (Temporal K Distribution): `G(φ → ψ) → (Gφ → Gψ)` - future distributes over implication
- **T4** (Temporal 4): `Gφ → GGφ` - future of future is future (transitivity)
- **TA** (Temporal A): `φ → GPφ` - the present was in the past of the future
- **TL** (Temporal L): `always φ → GPφ` - perpetuity implies recurrence

**Note**: Under reflexive semantics (Task 29), the T-axioms (Gφ → φ, Hφ → φ) ARE
valid and ARE included as `temp_t_future` and `temp_t_past`. Reflexive semantics
quantifies over s ≥ t, so the present is INCLUDED in temporal quantification.
This simplifies the canonical model construction by making reflexivity definitional
and eliminating the need for the canonicalR_irreflexive axiom.
### Modal-Temporal Interaction Axioms
- **MF** (Modal-Future): `□φ → □Fφ` - necessary truths remain necessary in future
- **TF** (Temporal-Future): `□φ → F□φ` - necessary truths were/will-be necessary

## Implementation Notes

- Each constructor represents an axiom schema (quantified over all formulas)
- The `Axiom` type is a predicate on `Formula`, not a separate type
- Axiom instances are used in the `Derivable` relation

Axiom schemata for bimodal logic TM.

A formula `φ` is an axiom if it matches one of the 19 axiom schema patterns.
Each constructor takes formula parameters representing the schema instantiation.

The axioms are organized into three categories based on frame conditions:
- **Base axioms** (15): Valid on all frames with linear temporal order
- **Dense extension** (1): `density` - valid on densely ordered frames
- **Discrete extension** (3): `discreteness_forward`, `seriality_future`, `seriality_past` -
  valid on discrete ordered frames with SuccOrder/NoMaxOrder/NoMinOrder

**Note (Task 991)**: Under strict temporal semantics (G/H quantify over s > t / s < t),
the T-axioms (Gφ → φ, Hφ → φ) are NOT valid and NOT included. This simplifies the
canonical model by making irreflexivity definitional.

Classification predicates:
- `isBase`: True for base axioms (neither density nor discreteness-specific)
- `isDenseCompatible`: True for axioms valid on dense frames (excludes `discreteness_forward`)
- `isDiscreteCompatible`: True for axioms valid on discrete frames (excludes `density`)

inductive Axiom : Formula → Type where
  /--
  Propositional K axiom: `(φ → (ψ → χ)) → ((φ → ψ) → (φ → χ))` (distribution).

  The distribution axiom for implication. If we have a way to derive χ from ψ
  assuming φ, and we have a way to derive ψ from φ, then we can derive χ from φ.
  This is a fundamental propositional tautology used in many proofs.
  -/
  | prop_k (φ ψ χ : Formula) :
      Axiom ((φ.imp (ψ.imp χ)).imp ((φ.imp ψ).imp (φ.imp χ)))

  /--
  Propositional S axiom: `φ → (ψ → φ)` (weakening).

  The weakening axiom for implication. A true formula remains true regardless
  of additional assumptions. This allows us to add hypotheses that are not used.
  This is a fundamental propositional tautology used in many proofs.
  -/
  | prop_s (φ ψ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.imp (ψ.imp φ))

  /--
  Modal T axiom: `□φ → φ` (reflexivity).

  What is necessarily true is actually true.
  Semantically: if φ holds at all possible worlds, it holds at the actual world.
  -/
  | modal_t (φ : Formula) : Axiom (Formula.box φ |>.imp φ)

  /--
  Modal 4 axiom: `□φ → □□φ` (transitivity).

  If something is necessary, it is necessarily necessary.
  Semantically: the accessibility relation is transitive.
  -/
  | modal_4 (φ : Formula) : Axiom ((Formula.box φ).imp (Formula.box (Formula.box φ)))

  /--
  Modal B axiom: `φ → □◇φ` (symmetry).

  Truths are necessarily possible.
  Semantically: the accessibility relation is symmetric.
  -/
  | modal_b (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.imp (Formula.box φ.diamond))

  /--
  Modal 5 Collapse axiom: `◇□φ → □φ` (S5 characteristic collapse).

  If it is possible that φ is necessary, then φ is necessary.
  This is the characteristic axiom of S5 that collapses nested modalities.

  Semantically: in S5 (where accessibility is an equivalence relation),
  if from the actual world we can access some world where □φ holds,
  then from that world we can access all worlds (including the actual world),
  so φ holds at all worlds, hence □φ at the actual world.

  This axiom enables:
  1. The S5 characteristic theorem `◇□A ↔ □A`
  2. Collapsing diamond-box patterns in modal reasoning
  3. Completing the modal distribution theorems in ModalS5.lean

  Note: Combined with B (`φ → □◇φ`) and 5 (`◇φ → □◇φ`, derived as `modal_5`),
  this completes the S5 modal logic.
  -/
  | modal_5_collapse (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.box.diamond.imp φ.box)

  /--
  Ex Falso Quodlibet (EFQ): `⊥ → φ` (explosion principle).

  From absurdity (`⊥`), anything can be derived. This axiom directly characterizes
  what `bot` means: if we have reached a contradiction, we can derive any formula.

  This is the fundamental principle that distinguishes absurdity from other formulas.
  Since `bot` is primitive in our syntax and `neg` is derived (`¬φ = φ → ⊥`), this
  axiom directly states what the primitive `bot` means.

  This axiom is accepted in both classical and intuitionistic logic. It provides
  the semantic content of the absurdity symbol without imposing classical reasoning.

  Semantically: In classical two-valued logic, `⊥` is false at all models, so the
  implication `⊥ → φ` is vacuously true (false antecedent). In task semantics,
  `truth_at M τ t ht Formula.bot = False`, so the implication is valid.

  **Historical Note**: Also called the "principle of explosion" (Latin: *ex falso
  [sequitur] quodlibet*, "from falsehood, anything [follows]").
  -/
  | ex_falso (φ : Formula) : Axiom (Formula.bot.imp φ)

  /--
  Peirce's Law: `((φ → ψ) → φ) → φ` (classical implication principle).

  Pure implicational classical reasoning. If assuming that (φ implies ψ) leads
  to φ, then φ holds. This is the characteristic axiom that distinguishes
  classical from intuitionistic logic in purely implicational form.

  This axiom is equivalent to the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) and Double
  Negation Elimination (DNE) in the presence of other propositional axioms,
  but it expresses classical reasoning using only implication, without
  mentioning negation or disjunction.

  Semantically: Valid in classical logic where every formula is either true
  or false at each model-history-time triple. The semantic proof uses case
  analysis: if φ is false, then φ → ψ is vacuously true (false antecedent),
  so from (φ → ψ) → φ we get φ, contradicting the assumption that φ is false.
  Therefore φ must be true.

  **Historical Note**: Named after the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce
  (1839-1914), who studied this principle in his work on the logic of relations.
  -/
  | peirce (φ ψ : Formula) : Axiom (((φ.imp ψ).imp φ).imp φ)

  /--
  Modal K Distribution axiom: `□(φ → ψ) → (□φ → □ψ)` (distribution).

  Necessity distributes over implication. If it is necessary that φ implies ψ,
  then if φ is necessary, ψ must also be necessary.

  This is the fundamental axiom of normal modal logics (K, T, S4, S5).
  It enables combining boxed formulas: from `⊢ □A` and `⊢ □B`, we can derive `⊢ □(A ∧ B)`
  by first deriving `⊢ □(A → (B → A∧B))` via necessitation, then applying this axiom twice.

  Semantically: in Kripke semantics, if φ → ψ holds at all accessible worlds,
  and φ holds at all accessible worlds, then ψ must hold at all accessible worlds.

  This axiom is sound in task semantics due to the S5 modal structure (Corollary 2.11).
  -/
  | modal_k_dist (φ ψ : Formula) :
      Axiom ((φ.imp ψ).box.imp (φ.box.imp ψ.box))

  /--
  Temporal K Distribution axiom: `F(φ → ψ) → (Fφ → Fψ)` (distribution).

  Future distributes over implication. If it will always be the case that φ implies ψ,
  then if φ will always be true, ψ will also always be true.

  This is the temporal analog of modal K distribution. It is the fundamental axiom
  of normal temporal logics. It enables combining future formulas: from `⊢ Fφ` and
  `⊢ Fψ`, we can derive `⊢ F(φ ∧ ψ)` by first deriving `⊢ F(φ → (ψ → φ∧ψ))` via
  temporal necessitation, then applying this axiom twice.

  Semantically: if (φ → ψ) holds at all future times, and φ holds at all future
  times, then ψ must hold at all future times.

  This axiom is sound in task semantics due to the linear temporal structure.
  -/
  | temp_k_dist (φ ψ : Formula) :
      Axiom ((φ.imp ψ).all_future.imp (φ.all_future.imp ψ.all_future))

  /--
  Temporal 4 axiom: `Fφ → FFφ` (temporal transitivity).

  If something will always be true, it will always be true that it will always be true.
  -/
  | temp_4 (φ : Formula) :
    Axiom ((Formula.all_future φ).imp (Formula.all_future (Formula.all_future φ)))

  /--
  Temporal A axiom: `φ → F(sometime_past φ)` (temporal connectedness).

  If something is true now, at all future times there exists a past time where it was true.
  Semantically: if φ at t, then for all s > t, there exists r < s where φ at r (namely, t).

  Note: Uses existential `sometime_past` (¬P¬φ) not universal `past` (Pφ).
  -/
  | temp_a (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.imp (Formula.all_future φ.sometime_past))

  /--
  Temporal L axiom: `△φ → F(Pφ)` (temporal introspection).

  Following JPL paper §sec:Appendix (line 1040, thm:temporal-axioms-valid line 2325):
  If φ holds at ALL times (always φ = Past φ ∧ φ ∧ Future φ), then at all
  future times, φ holds at all past times.

  **Paper Proof** (line 2334):
  Suppose M,τ,x ⊨ always φ. Then M,τ,y ⊨ φ for all y ∈ T.
  To show M,τ,x ⊨ Future Past φ, consider any z > x.
  We must show M,τ,z ⊨ Past φ, i.e., M,τ,w ⊨ φ for all w < z.
  But this holds by our assumption that φ holds at all times in τ.

  This axiom is trivially valid because the premise (φ at ALL times)
  immediately implies the conclusion (φ at times w < z for any z).
  -/
  | temp_l (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.always.imp (Formula.all_future (Formula.all_past φ)))

  /--
  Temporal T axiom (future): `Gφ → φ` (reflexivity of future).

  What holds at all future times (including now) holds at the present.
  This axiom is valid because reflexive semantics uses ≤ (not <), so t ≤ t.

  **Task 29**: This axiom was added when switching from strict to reflexive
  temporal semantics. Under reflexive semantics, Gφ at t means "φ at all s ≥ t",
  which includes t itself. Hence Gφ → φ is valid by taking s = t.

  Semantically: `Gφ` at t means ∀s ≥ t, φ(s). Since t ≥ t (reflexivity), φ(t).
  -/
  | temp_t_future (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.all_future.imp φ)

  /--
  Temporal T axiom (past): `Hφ → φ` (reflexivity of past).

  What holds at all past times (including now) holds at the present.
  This axiom is valid because reflexive semantics uses ≤ (not <), so t ≤ t.

  **Task 29**: This axiom was added when switching from strict to reflexive
  temporal semantics. Under reflexive semantics, Hφ at t means "φ at all s ≤ t",
  which includes t itself. Hence Hφ → φ is valid by taking s = t.

  Semantically: `Hφ` at t means ∀s ≤ t, φ(s). Since t ≤ t (reflexivity), φ(t).
  -/
  | temp_t_past (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.all_past.imp φ)

  /--
  Modal-Future axiom: `□φ → □Fφ` (modal-future interaction).

  Necessary truths remain necessary in the future.
  -/
  | modal_future (φ : Formula) : Axiom ((Formula.box φ).imp (Formula.box (Formula.all_future φ)))

  /--
  Temporal-Future axiom: `□φ → F□φ` (temporal-modal interaction).

  Necessary truths will always be necessary.
  -/
  | temp_future (φ : Formula) : Axiom ((Formula.box φ).imp (Formula.all_future (Formula.box φ)))

  /--
  Temporal Linearity axiom: `F(φ) ∧ F(ψ) → F(φ ∧ ψ) ∨ F(φ ∧ F(ψ)) ∨ F(F(φ) ∧ ψ)`
  (future-directedness / linear time).

  If two formulas both hold at some future time, then either they coincide, or
  one precedes the other. This axiom characterizes linear temporal order and is
  sound for the intended linear integer time semantics.

  Semantically: given witnesses s1 ≥ t for φ and s2 ≥ t for ψ, either s1 = s2
  (first disjunct), s1 ≤ s2 (second disjunct), or s2 ≤ s1 (third disjunct).
  This trichotomy holds because D is linearly ordered.

  **Technical Debt (Task 922)**: This axiom extends the TM system to enforce
  linearity of the temporal order. It is sound for linear integer time (the
  intended semantics) but was not part of the original axiom set. It is required
  for the canonical quotient completeness proof because the original TM axioms
  do not derive linearity -- a branching-time frame satisfying all other TM axioms
  exists as a counterexample. Remediation: derive from existing axioms if possible,
  or document as a permanent axiom of TM.

  /--
  Density axiom (DN): `GGφ → Gφ` (dense temporal order, Sahlqvist form).

  If φ holds at all times strictly after all times strictly after now,
  then φ holds at all times strictly after now.

  **Frame condition**: DN is valid on a frame iff the temporal order is densely
  ordered: for all t < s, there exists u with t < u < s.

  Semantically (under strict semantics):
  - `GGφ` at t means: ∀r > t, ∀s > r, φ(s)
  - `Gφ` at t means: ∀s > t, φ(s)
  - For any s > t, by density ∃r with t < r < s. Then GGφ gives Gφ at r,
    which gives φ at s (since s > r). Hence φ at s.

  **Sahlqvist form**: This formulation is Sahlqvist (boxed antecedent, positive
  consequent), giving automatic canonicity and frame correspondence.

  **Note (Task 991)**: The dual existential form `Fφ → FFφ` is also valid on
  dense orders (and equivalent), but we prefer the Sahlqvist universal form
  for canonical completeness.

      Axiom ((φ.all_future.all_future).imp φ.all_future)

  /--
  Forward discreteness axiom (DF): `(F⊤ ∧ φ ∧ Hφ) → F(Hφ)` (discrete temporal order).

  If there is a strict future time (F⊤), and φ holds now and at all past times (Hφ),
  then there exists a future time where Hφ holds. This captures the existence of
  immediate successors: if there is any future, the immediate successor satisfies Hφ
  because φ holds at all times up to and including now.

  **Frame condition**: DF is valid on a frame iff the temporal order has immediate
  successors (SuccOrder). The past axiom DP (backward discreteness) is derivable
  from DF via the temporal_duality inference rule.

  /--
  Seriality axiom (future): `Gφ → Fφ` (there exists a future time, Sahlqvist form).

  If φ holds at all strictly future times, then φ holds at some strictly
  future time. This is equivalent to asserting that there exists a strictly
  future time (no maximum element in the temporal order).

  **Frame condition**: Valid iff `NoMaxOrder D` on the frame.

  Semantically (under strict semantics):
  - `Gφ` at t means: ∀s > t, φ(s)
  - `Fφ` at t means: ∃s > t, φ(s)
  - If there exists any s > t (NoMaxOrder), then Gφ → Fφ: the universal
    quantification implies the existential since the domain is non-empty.

  **Sahlqvist form**: This formulation is Sahlqvist (boxed antecedent, positive
  consequent), giving automatic canonicity and frame correspondence.

  **Note (Task 991)**: The simpler `F⊤` is also equivalent but we prefer
  the Sahlqvist form for canonical completeness.

  | seriality_future (φ : Formula) : Axiom (φ.all_future.imp φ.some_future)

  /--
  Seriality axiom (past): `Hφ → Pφ` (there exists a past time, Sahlqvist form).

  If φ holds at all strictly past times, then φ holds at some strictly
  past time. This is equivalent to asserting that there exists a strictly
  past time (no minimum element in the temporal order).

  **Frame condition**: Valid iff `NoMinOrder D` on the frame.

  Semantically (under strict semantics):
  - `Hφ` at t means: ∀s < t, φ(s)
  - `Pφ` at t means: ∃s < t, φ(s)
  - If there exists any s < t (NoMinOrder), then Hφ → Pφ: the universal
    quantification implies the existential since the domain is non-empty.

  **Sahlqvist form**: This formulation is Sahlqvist (boxed antecedent, positive
  consequent), giving automatic canonicity and frame correspondence.

  **Note (Task 991)**: The simpler `P⊤` is also equivalent but we prefer

Classification of frame conditions required for axiom validity.

- `Base`: Axioms valid on all linear orders (no special frame conditions).
  These 15 axioms form the core TM logic.
- `Dense`: Axioms requiring DenselyOrdered frames. The `density` axiom (DN)
  is the only axiom in this class.
- `Discrete`: Axioms requiring discrete frames with SuccOrder/NoMaxOrder/NoMinOrder.
  Includes `discreteness_forward`, `seriality_future`, `seriality_past`.

**Hierarchy**: Base ⊂ Dense ∪ Discrete (base axioms valid in both extensions)

The classification determines which axioms can be used in completeness proofs:
- Base completeness: only Base axioms
- Dense completeness: Base ∪ Dense axioms
- Discrete completeness: Base ∪ Discrete axioms

Note: Mixing Dense and Discrete axioms yields an inconsistent logic
(no frame can be both densely ordered and have immediate successors).

**DEPRECATION NOTICE** (Task 978):
This enum-based classification is superseded by the typeclass architecture
in `Bimodal.FrameConditions`. For new code, prefer:
- `LinearTemporalFrame`: replaces FrameClass.Base
- `DenseTemporalFrame`: replaces FrameClass.Dense
- `DiscreteTemporalFrame`: replaces FrameClass.Discrete

The typeclasses provide stronger type-level guarantees and integrate
with Mathlib's order typeclass hierarchy.

/-! ### FrameClass Consistency Lemmas

These lemmas verify consistency between the `FrameClass` enumeration and
the existing boolean predicates (`isBase`, `isDenseCompatible`, `isDiscreteCompatible`).

**Note on predicate semantics**: The existing predicates `isDenseCompatible` and
`isDiscreteCompatible` have slightly different semantics than FrameClass:
- `isDenseCompatible` only excludes `discreteness_forward` (not seriality axioms)
- `isDiscreteCompatible` only excludes `density`

The FrameClass enumeration provides a more refined classification where:
- `FrameClass.Discrete` includes seriality axioms along with discreteness_forward
- This is semantically correct: seriality axioms require NoMaxOrder/NoMinOrder which
  are discrete frame conditions

For precise classification, use `frameClass`. The existing predicates are preserved
for backward compatibility.
