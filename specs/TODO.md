## Tasks

### 503. Revise representation section with literature
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: formal
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Review <sec:representation> (line 1151 and following) in /home/benjamin/Projects/BimodalLogic/typst/FormalFoundations.typ and /home/benjamin/Projects/BimodalLogic/FormalSystem/Metalogic/Algebraic/ to get a sense of where things stand, then review what literature sources are available already and which standard sources are missing in order to download and ingest these sources, then research these sources to gain a more complete understanding of standard representation theorems in modal logic in order to systematically revise <sec:representation> in /home/benjamin/Projects/BimodalLogic/typst/FormalFoundations.typ to provide a more careful and complete overview of what is intended, building up the elements that are needed towards achieving this result, and saying what remains honestly so I can contemplate the way forward

### 502. Ground algebraic representation in goldblatt and brv
- **Effort**: 12-20 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: formal
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 461

**Description**: RESEARCH TASK. Ground the algebraic representation front in the literature BEFORE the STSA axiom set is fixed and before Uf(A) is constructed. Gates the STSA port; the complex-algebra and ultrafilter-frame tasks inherit the gate transitively.

WHY THIS RUNS EARLY. Goldblatt 1989 is largely about which varieties of Boolean algebras with operators are complex algebras, and about canonicity. Those are design questions for the STSA axiomatization and for the Uf(A) construction, not questions the eta-embedding capstone can act on. On the pre-existing graph this paper was ingested in wave 1 and not opened until wave 4, by which point three tasks would have committed to designs it should have informed.

PRIMARY SOURCE, WITH A HARD READING CONSTRAINT. Goldblatt, R. "Varieties of complex algebras", Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 44 (1989) 173-242, doi 10.1016/0168-0072(89)90032-8. The acquired PDF is an Acrobat 3.0 Capture scan (70 pages) whose OCR text layer is UNRELIABLE ON MATHEMATICS: symbols mangle, lines drop and reorder, and even the title page renders New Zealand as "New 2Miand". READ THE PAGE IMAGES via the Read tool's pages parameter. Do NOT grep the text layer for definitions or theorem statements, and do NOT accept a pdftotext- or /literature --convert-derived markdown as a faithful source for any axiom or equation. The text layer is usable only as a rough locator.

PAGINATION. Journal page 173 is PDF page 1, so PDF page = journal page - 172. The paper's own table of contents is partly OCR-garbled in its page-number column; verify each section start against the actual page image rather than trusting the offsets below.

SECTIONS IN SCOPE (do not read the whole paper):
- 2.2 The dual space of a lattice (journal ~185) and 2.3 Bounded morphisms (~192) -- the duality machinery the eta embedding rests on.
- 3.1 Canonical structures (~198) -- the canonical extension / Uf(A) construction. Bears directly on the ultrafilter-frame task.
- 3.5 Canonical varieties (~208) -- IS THE STSA VARIETY CANONICAL? This is the single most load-bearing question for the STSA port, which must restate three Boneyard sorries against the current 45-constructor axiom set and should not do so blind.
- 3.6 The elementary case (~210) and 3.8 First-order definability -- bears on whether the Spherical frame condition is first-order definable and preserved, which is the ultrafilter-frame task's dominant and explicitly unattempted obligation, and one the paper's finite-W discharge pattern does not cover.
- 4.2 Preservation by bounded morphisms and inner substructures (~229) -- whether the TaskFrame axioms transfer along the constructions.
EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE: 2.4 Heyting algebras (intuitionistic, not this signature).

CROSS-FRONT NOTE, RECORD BUT DO NOT PURSUE HERE: section 4.3 covers preservation by DISJOINT UNIONS, which may bear on the two-fibre structure named in Metalogic/Conservativity.lean as the CEB countermodel shape. That belongs to the TM-completeness research task on the metalogic front; if 4.3 looks relevant, record a pointer for that task rather than expanding this one.

SECONDARY SOURCE: Blackburn/de Rijke/Venema 2002 Chapter 5 (corpus entry blackburn_2002, born-digital, full text) is the standard Jonsson-Tarski reference and should be read alongside. CAVEAT: the corpus warns this entry is 365,868 tokens and exceeds a single context budget -- create a chapter-scoped sub-entry before an agent consumes it.

DELIVERABLE: a grounding report answering, with citations to specific pages read as images: (1) does the STSA axiom set as seeded in Boneyard/UltrafilterFrame/TenseS5Algebra.lean match the standard BAO presentation, and where does it diverge; (2) is the variety canonical, and what does that buy or cost the representation; (3) what the literature says about discharging a Spherical-style frame condition on an ultrafilter frame; (4) a concrete recommendation on how the three removed-axiom sorries (temp_a, temp_l) should be restated against the current axiom set. A finding that the literature does NOT settle one of these is a complete and valid answer for that item -- record it as unsettled rather than manufacturing a verdict.

### 501. Extend stsa with until since operators
- **Effort**: 20-32 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 125

**Description**: Phase 4 of the Jonsson-Tarski representation: extend STSA with the binary Until and Since operators. The STSA class as seeded in Boneyard/UltrafilterFrame/TenseS5Algebra.lean carries only the unary box, G, H and sigma. The live object language's primitives are untl and snce (Formula, Syntax/Formula.lean), with allFuture and allPast DERIVED from them (:167, :177) -- so an STSA over the unary fragment alone does not represent the actual logic, and the representation theorem is incomplete without this. SCOPE: add binary operators to the STSA signature with their algebraic laws, extend the complex algebra Cm(F) to interpret them from the frame relations, extend the ultrafilter frame Uf(A) correspondingly, and re-prove the eta embedding at the extended signature. SEQUENCING: this deliberately follows the unary capstone rather than being folded into it -- the unary representation is a standalone result worth landing first, and folding the binary case in would make a single task that cannot complete in one dispatch. LITERATURE: Blackburn/de Rijke/Venema 2002 Chapter 5 (in the corpus as blackburn_2002, full text) is the standard reference for Jonsson-Tarski and its extensions to n-ary operators. Note the corpus warns blackburn_2002 exceeds a single context budget at 365,868 tokens -- a chapter-scoped sub-entry should be created before an agent consumes it.

### 500. Reconcile shiftset representation with stsa route
- **Effort**: 10-16 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: formal
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 492, Task 497

**Description**: RESEARCH TASK. Prevent two parallel representation theorems from being developed and having to be reconciled after the fact. THE OBSERVATION: FormalSystem/Semantics/ShiftSet.lean -- landed by task 424 for the COMPACTNESS route -- is already a representation theorem. forward_repr (:263) and reverse_repr (:362) represent task models as shift sets, both directions, sorry-free. Separately, the STSA design report (specs/archive/992_shift_closed_tense_s5_algebra/reports/01_stsa-algebraic-analysis.md) identifies its key structural claim as: box a <= box(G a) meet G(box a) says the box-fixed points form a G-invariant subalgebra, which is the algebraic encoding of OMEGA BEING SHIFT-CLOSED. That is the same shift structure ShiftSet.lean makes explicit. These look like two views of one representation. SCOPE: determine whether they are, and if so, specify the shared infrastructure so the algebraic route consumes ShiftSet rather than duplicating it. Concretely: (a) is Cm(F) expressible as an algebra of shift-invariant subsets of a ShiftSet carrier? (b) does ShiftSet's sep hypothesis correspond to an STSA axiom, and if so which? (c) can the eta embedding be factored through reverse_repr? DELIVERABLE: a report with a verdict and, if affirmative, a concrete refactor specification. A NEGATIVE VERDICT IS A COMPLETE OUTCOME -- if the two representations are genuinely different objects, say so with evidence and record it so the question is not reopened. TIMING: run this after the Los-lemma work and the STSA port have both landed, so both sides are concrete rather than projected.

### 499. Build ultrafilter frame and prove task frame axioms
- **Effort**: 24-40 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 497

**Description**: HARD. Phase 2 of the Jonsson-Tarski representation: the ultrafilter frame Uf(A), and the proof that it is a TaskFrame. THE SEED: Boneyard/UltrafilterFrame/UltrafilterFrame.lean (1189 lines, behind #exit, 4 sorry hits) already has R_G (:82), R_Box (:90), R_H (:98) and a substantial body of proved structure -- R_Box_refl (:111), R_Box_euclidean (:127), R_Box_symm (:154), R_Box_trans (:164), R_G_R_H_converse (:179), the preimage and upward-closure lemmas (:229-251), R_G_trans (:281), R_H_trans (:304), and the F/P resolution lemmas (:515, :750). Port and revive rather than rebuild. THE GENUINELY NEW OBLIGATION, flagged in task 125's own FOUR-AXIOM EXPOSURE NOTE (2026-08-10): proving SPHERICAL for an ultrafilter frame is nontrivial and unattempted, and the paper's finite-W discharge pattern EXPLICITLY DOES NOT APPLY. Budget this as the dominant cost of the task; Compositionality, Seriality and Limit are expected to be far cheaper. MATHLIB HOOKS: Order/PrimeSeparator.lean:44 (DistribLattice.prime_ideal_of_disjoint_filter_ideal -- the Boolean prime ideal theorem in distributive-lattice form) is what a Zorn-free Uf(A)-nonemptiness argument should use; Order/Ideal.lean and Order/PrimeIdeal.lean (:156, :171) give the ultrafilter-as-prime-filter characterization. NOTE: Mathlib has NO Ultrafilter on an abstract Boolean algebra -- its Ultrafilter is Filter-on-Set-based. UltrafilterMCS.lean:44 rolls its own structure for exactly this reason, and its MCS-to-ultrafilter bijection (ultrafilter_correspondence :782) is available, though stated existentially rather than as a named Equiv. SHADOWING HAZARD: if Mathlib's Ultrafilter is opened in that namespace it collides with the bespoke one; keep them explicitly qualified.

### 498. Build complex algebra for task frames
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 497

**Description**: Phase 1 of the Jonsson-Tarski representation: the complex algebra Cm(F). Construct the powerset STSA over a TaskFrame -- carrier the powerset of the world-history space, with box, G, H and sigma defined from the frame relations -- and prove it satisfies every STSA axiom. GREENFIELD WARNING: Mathlib has NO Boolean algebras with operators, no complex algebras, no canonical extensions, and no modal-algebra machinery of any kind; a survey of the pinned v4.33.0-rc1 tree found nothing reusable for this. What Mathlib DOES supply and should be used: Order/BooleanAlgebra/ (already consumed by BooleanStructure.lean:421) and Order/CompleteBooleanAlgebra.lean:711 (CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra). CONSTRAINT FROM THE FOUR-AXIOM WORK (task 420, completed): TaskFrame (Semantics/TaskFrame.lean:474-577) now carries SEVEN fields, not five -- biconditional Compositionality, Seriality, Limit and Spherical plus a Nonempty WorldState field and [Nontrivial D]. The complex algebra must be built against the live seven-field structure, not the five-field shape the older design documents assume. ACCEPTANCE: Cm(F) defined, instance STSA (Cm F) proved, sorry-free, lake build green.

### 497. Port stsa class and add g operator
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 496, Task 502

**Description**: Bring the Shift-closed Tense S5 Algebra class into live code and close the G-operator gap. Phase 1 groundwork for the Jonsson-Tarski representation. THE SEED: Boneyard/UltrafilterFrame/TenseS5Algebra.lean (361 lines, behind #exit) already contains the full class STSA extending BooleanAlgebra with fields box, G, H, sigma and axioms box_deflationary, box_monotone, box_idempotent, box_s5, G_monotone, H_monotone, sigma_involution, sigma_neg, sigma_sup, sigma_G, sigma_H, sigma_box, MF, TF, TA, TL. This is the exact algebraic signature the representation needs. IT CARRIES 3 SORRIES, AND THEY MUST NOT BE PROVED AS-IS: they are for temp_a and temp_l, axioms that have since been REMOVED or restructured; restate them against the current 45-constructor ProofSystem.Axiom set (Axioms.lean:115-464) rather than reviving the old shapes. THE G GAP: LindenbaumQuotient.lean supplies boxQuot (:305-ish), hQuot, and sigmaQuot (:346) with its four laws (sigma_quot_involution :353, sigma_quot_neg :362, sigma_quot_sup :373, sigma_quot_box :385) -- but there is NO gQuot. G on the Lindenbaum quotient must be constructed and its congruence proved before LindenbaumAlg can be an STSA instance. Boneyard/SorriedDeclExcisions/AlgebraicGQuotChain.lean is the excised prior attempt and should be consulted, not trusted. DESIGN REFERENCE: specs/archive/992_shift_closed_tense_s5_algebra/reports/01_stsa-algebraic-analysis.md (538 lines) gives the full axiom-to-equation translation table and the key structural claim that box a <= box(G a) meet G(box a) says the box-fixed points form a G-invariant subalgebra -- the algebraic encoding of Omega being shift-closed. It is stale on file names (references deleted AlgebraicRepresentation.lean and ParametricRepresentation.lean) but sound on the mathematics. ACCEPTANCE: STSA class live and sorry-free, gQuot constructed with congruence, instance STSA LindenbaumAlg, lake build green.

### 496. Research algebraic stack build graph wiring
- **Effort**: 6-10 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [496_research_algebraic_stack_build_graph_wiring/reports/01_algebraic-stack-build-graph-wiring.md]
- **Plan**: [496_research_algebraic_stack_build_graph_wiring/plans/01_wire-algebraic-stack-fix-readme.md]
- **Summary**: [496_research_algebraic_stack_build_graph_wiring/summaries/01_wire-algebraic-stack-fix-readme-summary.md]

**Description**: RESEARCH TASK, UNBLOCKED TODAY. Decide whether the algebraic stack should be wired into the build graph, and settle the elaboration-conflict question before anything is built on top of it. THE FINDING: FormalSystem/Metalogic/Algebraic/ holds five sorry-free files, but only FlowFrame.lean (806 lines, 6 live importers) is reachable from the default target root FormalSystem.lean. BooleanStructure.lean (441), InteriorOperators.lean (176), LindenbaumQuotient.lean (393) and UltrafilterMCS.lean (1071) -- 2,081 lines, and exactly the part relevant to Jonsson-Tarski -- are ORPHANED: no live .lean file anywhere imports FormalSystem.Metalogic.Algebraic, verified by grep returning zero hits. The aggregator exists only to satisfy the C8 sibling-aggregator invariant (scripts/check-module-invariants.sh:418-449). They are LSP-checked and manifested under C6, but not verified by lake build. Stale oleans for deleted modules dated 2026-08-10 sit in .lake/build/, so build artifacts there are NOT evidence of reachability. THE RISK TO ADJUDICATE: Boneyard/UltrafilterFrame/README.md records that that subtree was archived on 2026-05-20 because of 'elaboration conflicts with BXCanonical completeness'. It is UNKNOWN whether those conflicts were specific to the Boneyard files or would also bite the currently-orphaned Algebraic/ stack if it were imported live. Determine this empirically before recommending. DELIVERABLE: a report recommending either (a) re-wire -- import the aggregator from a live module so lake build covers the stack, with measured build-time delta and any elaboration conflicts named; or (b) keep isolation-only and document it honestly. EITHER WAY, fix two overstatements in Algebraic/README.md: it claims 'this directory is not optional' and 'participates in the live proof' (true only of FlowFrame.lean), and it claims 'G and H are shown to be interior operators' when InteriorOperators.lean proves only H_monotone (:80) plus the box triple (:101, :112, :130) -- there is no G operator on the quotient at all.

### 495. Determine tm completeness status over task frames
- **Effort**: 12-20 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: formal
- **Topic**: metalogic
- **Dependencies**: Task 489

**Description**: RESEARCH TASK, DELIBERATELY AGNOSTIC ABOUT THE VERDICT. Determine whether TM (the BaseLanguage proof system) is complete over task frames, and if not, characterize what it IS complete for. DO NOT ASSUME COMPLETENESS HOLDS; the evidence points the other way, and a machine-checked incompleteness result is a complete and valid outcome. EVIDENCE THAT IT MAY FAIL: (1) the paper's cor:tm-completeness (possible_worlds.tex:4657) carries completeness for the BL+ systems ONLY -- TM+, TM+_d, TM+_f, TM+_c -- and never claims it for TM. (2) Metalogic/Conservativity.lean's scope section states that the forward direction TM+ |- tr phi => TM |- phi is REFUTED at FrameClass.Base (the (Sp) witness) and at FrameClass.Discrete (the Z1 witness), with the TM+ half of the Discrete witness already machine-checked in-tree as z1_translate. THE SUBTLETY ANY DISPATCH MUST CONFRONT FIRST: since |-[Base] tr (Sp) is proved and TM+ is sound over all task frames, (Sp) is VALID ON EVERY TASK FRAME. So a refutation of TM |- Sp by soundness CANNOT use a task frame. It needs a structure outside the class on which TM remains sound precisely because it lacks the Until/Since expressive power to detect the violation. Identifying that broader class is the actual research content. SCOPE: (a) settle whether TM is complete over task frames; (b) if not, identify the class TM is sound and complete for; (c) determine whether the CEB and CEF refutations that Conservativity.lean currently only DOCUMENTS can now be machine-checked, given the BL-side semantics and soundness theorem delivered by the prerequisite task. Conservativity.lean's own 'What a machine-checked refutation would need' section names three missing pieces: a BL-side semantics, a BL-side soundness theorem, and the two countermodels (a two-fibre structure for CEB, Z x_lex Z for CEF); the prerequisite supplies the first two. HARD CONSTRAINT INHERITED FROM Conservativity.lean: do not state a forward-conservativity theorem and discharge it with sorry -- it is provably false at two frame classes, so that would be an unsound placeholder, not deferred debt.

---

### 494. Define and refute dedekind compactness
- **Effort**: 10-16 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: strong_completeness
- **Dependencies**: Task 490

**Description**: UNBLOCKED TODAY, INDEPENDENT of the ultraproduct chain. Settle the fourth frame class negatively and complete the compactness picture. CURRENT STATE: there is NO CompactDedekind definition anywhere in the tree, no StrongCompletenessDedekind, no SatisfiableDedekindSet, and no refutation -- the Dedekind row of StrongCompleteness.lean's status ledger (:84-89) rests on the scope of Reynolds 1992 section 9 Theorem 7 alone. Meanwhile the paper (cor:tm-completeness, possible_worlds.tex:4657) asserts that strong completeness 'provably fails for Z-time as well as for the dense-and-complete class R where compactness fails' -- so this is a REFUTATION target, not a proof target. DELIVERABLE PART 1: define the missing vocabulary in SetConsequence.lean mirroring the Base/Dense/Discrete groups -- SetSemanticConsequenceDedekindDense already exists (:103); add StrongCompletenessDedekind, CompactDedekind, SatisfiableDedekindSet, ModelExistenceDedekind. PART 2: refute CompactDedekind and StrongCompletenessDedekind. CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: the Discrete witness does NOT port. archWitness (DiscreteNonCompactness.lean:102) and its unsatisfiability half (:229-242) turn entirely on Order.succ_le_of_lt and exists_succ_iterate, i.e. on [SuccOrder D] + [IsSuccArchimedean D]; the Dedekind binder list is DenselyOrdered plus LUB with no successor at all, and over R the operator Formula.next = untl bot phi is vacuous, so archWitness carries no contradiction. A NEW witness is required. Model DiscreteNonCompactness.lean's structure (finitely-satisfiable half, then unsatisfiable half) but not its witness. ACCEPTANCE: both refutations sorry-free and axiom-audited; the four-class compactness picture complete (Base/Dense open pending the ultraproduct chain, Discrete refuted, Dedekind refuted).

### 493. Discharge compactbase compactdense and strong completeness
- **Effort**: 10-16 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: strong_completeness
- **Dependencies**: Task 490, Task 492

**Description**: Assemble the compactness result and collect strong completeness for Base and Dense. Steps S4 and S5 of task 424's authorized route. S4: from the Los lemma, prove ModelExistenceBase and ModelExistenceDense (every finitely-satisfiable Gamma is satisfiable), then compose with the ModelExistence -> Compact bridge to obtain CompactBase and CompactDense. S5: feed those into strongCompletenessBase_of_compact (StrongCompleteness.lean:305) and strongCompletenessDense_of_compact (:331), which are already proved as reductions, and DISCHARGE their engine hypotheses -- deliberately left live so that compactness was isolated as the whole remaining obligation. The engines are BXCanonical.completeness (BXCanonical/Completeness.lean:196) for Base and BXCanonical.completeness_dense (:256) for Dense, both sorry-free and both of exactly the required type. WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND THE TREE: the paper's cor:tm-completeness rows 1 and 2 assert strong completeness for TM+ and TM+_d and attribute them to this repository, where they are currently CONDITIONAL on unproved hypotheses. This task is what makes the paper's own headline claim true; task 488's author memo records the mismatch as a live paper-side correction until then. ACCEPTANCE: StrongCompletenessBase and StrongCompletenessDense proved unconditionally, sorry-free, axiom-audited; the author-memo item retired.

### 492. Build shiftset ultraproduct and los lemma
- **Effort**: 20-30 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: strong_completeness
- **Dependencies**: Task 491

**Description**: HARD. Build the ultraproduct of shift sets and prove Los for TruthAt. This is steps S2 and S3 of the route task 424 authorized. S2: construct the ultraproduct over an ultrafilter on the index type {L : List Formula // forall psi in L, psi in Gamma}, using the carrier route selected by the preceding research task -- do not re-litigate that choice here. S3: the Los lemma for TruthAt, by induction on Formula, six cases (atom, bot, imp, box, untl, snce). Five are mechanical. The box case is the real content and carries task 424's risk R2: it needs a choice-function argument for the forward direction, because box quantifies over all total world-histories (TruthAt, Semantics/Truth.lean:164) rather than over a pointwise-definable family. ACCEPTANCE: sorry-free, lake build green, #print axioms recorded for the Los statement (Classical.choice is expected and acceptable here; sorryAx is not). SEQUENCING NOTE: ShiftSet.lean's forward_repr/reverse_repr is the representation this builds on, and it is also the representation the algebraic route should reuse -- see the reconciliation task, which should not be allowed to fork a second, parallel representation. CARRIER ROUTE (SETTLED -- do not re-litigate): route (a), a bespoke quotient of the Pi group (forall i, D i) by its eventually-zero AddSubgroup, with AddCommGroup inherited free from QuotientAddGroup.Quotient.addCommGroup and only LE, LinearOrder, IsOrderedAddMonoid, Nontrivial (plus DenselyOrdered on the Dense branch) supplied by hand -- 5 instances, 6 on Dense, not the ~15 the design doc estimated. The history carrier is the parallel Quotient of (forall i, Omega i) by eventual equality, with the shift action lifted through both and sh_zero/sh_add discharged. Route (b), carrier normalization first, is a NO-GO: the only normalization machinery in the tree (DurationClassification.lean intIso, IntTransfer.lean TaskFrame.map) is Discrete-only, and DiscreteNonCompactness.lean discrete_consequence_not_compact refutes compactness exactly at Discrete. Do NOT import Mathlib.Order.Filter.Germ or FilterProduct: Filter.Product carries only coeTC and Inhabited, and Mathlib.Order.Filter.Ultrafilter.Basic (already built) supplies everything the route needs. EVIDENCE, COMPILED AND UNDER A BUILD TARGET: Tests/BimodalTest/Semantics/DependentUltraproductProbe.lean, imported from Tests/BimodalTest.lean, carries the whole carrier construction sorry-free with axiom profile [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; its shiftSetOnUD is the live check that ShiftSet (UD phi D) elaborates and that the quotient lands in Type. FULL REASONING: specs/491_select_dependent_ultraproduct_carrier_route/reports/01_dependent-ultraproduct-carrier-route.md (section 9 is the decision record, section 5 lists what S2 still owes). The probe deliberately does NOT supply: the ultrafilter on the index type, ShiftSet.sep, carrier_nonempty, or the valuation A -- shiftSetOnUD takes the last three as hypotheses. Those are this task's work.

### 491. Select dependent ultraproduct carrier route
- **Effort**: 6-10 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: strong_completeness
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [491_select_dependent_ultraproduct_carrier_route/reports/01_dependent-ultraproduct-carrier-route.md]
- **Plan**: [491_select_dependent_ultraproduct_carrier_route/plans/01_land-carrier-route-decision.md]
- **Summary**: [491_select_dependent_ultraproduct_carrier_route/summaries/01_land-carrier-route-decision-summary.md]

**Description**: RESEARCH TASK, UNBLOCKED TODAY. Decide how to build the ultraproduct carrier before any Los-lemma work starts. CONTEXT: task 424 PASSED the compactness feasibility gate and landed FormalSystem/Semantics/ShiftSet.lean (506 lines, sorry-free) with forward_repr (:263) and reverse_repr (:362). Its cancel condition did not fire: the one extra hypothesis needed, sep, is first-order over the two-sorted signature <Omega, D; <, +, 0, sh, (A_p)>, hence Los-preserved. THE PROBLEM (task 424's risk R1, its own largest named unknown): the index type is {L : List Formula // forall psi in L, psi in Gamma}, and the carriers D_L differ per finite subset, so the ultraproduct is DEPENDENT. Mathlib's ordered instances (Mathlib/Order/Filter/FilterProduct.lean:92, LinearOrder for Germ) live only on the NON-dependent Filter.Germ; the dependent Filter.Product (Mathlib/Order/Filter/Germ/Basic.lean:100) has no ordered-group instances. TWO ROUTES TO ADJUDICATE: (a) a bespoke quotient of (forall i, D i) with roughly 15 hand-supplied instances (AddCommGroup, LinearOrder, IsOrderedAddMonoid, Nontrivial, and the frame-class binders); (b) a carrier-normalization step that collapses the family to a single carrier first -- note task 475 (carrier_normalization_successor_archimedean_transfer, completed) may or may not supply reusable machinery, and whether it does is part of what this task must determine rather than assume. ALSO IN SCOPE: Mathlib build cost. Ultrafilter (Order/Filter/Ultrafilter/) is already built and free; Filter.Germ and FilterProduct are present in source but have NO oleans in this checkout, so importing them triggers a Mathlib build -- quantify it. DELIVERABLE: a research report naming the chosen route with evidence, the exact instance list route (a) would require, and a go/no-go on route (b). MUST NOT write the Los lemma.

### 490. Prove model existence implies compactness bridge
- **Effort**: 3-5 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: strong_completeness
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [490_prove_model_existence_implies_compactness_bridge/reports/01_model-existence-compactness-bridge.md]
- **Plan**: [490_prove_model_existence_implies_compactness_bridge/plans/01_land-compactness-bridge-theorems.md]
- **Summary**: [490_prove_model_existence_implies_compactness_bridge/summaries/01_land-compactness-bridge-theorems-summary.md]

**Description**: ROUTINE, UNBLOCKED TODAY. Close a silent second gap on the compactness route. FormalSystem/Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean states both ModelExistenceBase (:239-242) and CompactBase (:219-221), and the Dense siblings ModelExistenceDense (:283-286) and CompactDense (:263-265), but the implication ModelExistence -> Compact is NOT proved: the module docstrings at :234-238 and :278-282 say verbatim that 'that implication is future work and is not proved here'. The compactness programme is routinely described as having one gap (the model-existence theorem); it has two, and this is the cheap one. DELIVERABLE: theorems compactBase_of_modelExistence : ModelExistenceBase -> CompactBase and compactDense_of_modelExistenceDense : ModelExistenceDense -> CompactDense, in SetConsequence.lean or a sibling. ROUTE: contrapose through the Formula.neg clause of TruthAt plus the existing truthAt_foldr_imp (StrongCompleteness.lean:183); SetDerivable (:69) and the finite-restriction lemmas (:151, :156, :166, :174) are already available. ACCEPTANCE: both theorems sorry-free, #print axioms exactly [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], lake build green. DO NOT attempt the model-existence theorem itself here -- that is the ultraproduct work and is separately tasked.

### 489. Prove baselanguage soundness base and extensions
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: metalogic
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [489_prove_baselanguage_soundness_base_and_extensions/reports/01_bl-soundness-by-composition.md]
- **Plan**: [489_prove_baselanguage_soundness_base_and_extensions/plans/01_bl-soundness-composition.md]
- **Summary**: [489_prove_baselanguage_soundness_base_and_extensions/summaries/01_bl-soundness-composition-summary.md]

**Description**: Prove soundness for the BaseLanguage (BL) proof system -- the paper's TM -- establishing it at FrameClass.Base first and then extending to Dense, Discrete and Dedekind, mirroring Metalogic/Soundness.lean's Base-then-extensions structure. This gives thm:TM-soundness (possible_worlds.tex:4484) a direct Lean counterpart and retires a live over-claim: the paper asserts at four sites (:1661, :4311, :4484, :4494) that TM's soundness is formalized here, and only the TM+ half of each sentence is currently supported.

THE ROUTE IS COMPOSITION, NOT A SECOND SEMANTICS. def:BL-semantics (possible_worlds.tex:3566) defines a BL model as <W, D, =>, |.|> where <W, D, =>> IS A TASK FRAME -- the same structure TM+ uses -- with clauses for p, bot, ->, box, H and G identical to TM+'s clauses for those six connectives. And tr (BaseLanguage/Translation.lean:69) is a structural homomorphism on exactly those six primitives, every push-through equation rfl (:82-87).

DELIVERABLE 1 -- FormalSystem/BaseLanguage/Semantics.lean: define BLTruthAt by recursion on BLFormula, transcribing def:BL-semantics clause for clause. The box clause quantifies over TOTAL world-histories (matching TruthAt, Semantics/Truth.lean:164, and H_F in the paper). Then BLValid, BLValidDense, BLValidDiscrete and BLValidDedekindDense mirroring Semantics/Validity.lean (:103, :206, :248, :336).

DELIVERABLE 2 -- the truth-transfer bridge: TruthAt M tau x (tr phi) <-> BLTruthAt M tau x phi, by induction on phi. Four of the six cases are definitional. The allPast and allFuture cases are the only ones with content, because Formula.allFuture/allPast are DERIVED from untl/snce (Syntax/Formula.lean:167, :177) -- and they are already discharged by the existing @[simp] lemmas future_iff (Semantics/Truth.lean:287) and past_iff (:305), which state exactly the paper's G and H clauses.

DELIVERABLE 3 -- four soundness theorems by composition: Metalogic.Conservativity.translate (already proved, already fc-parameterized) into soundness (Soundness.lean:1086), soundness_dense (:1260), soundness_discrete (:1406) and soundness_dedekind (:1933), then across the bridge. The Base-then-extensions structure is inherited free: BaseLanguage.Axiom.minFrameClass reuses ProofSystem.FrameClass and only df/dn/co are non-Base, so TM, TM_f, TM_d and TM_dc are four instantiations of one derivation type.

DELIVERABLE 4 -- consistency corollaries mirroring not_derivable_nil_bot (Soundness.lean:1993).

FORBIDDEN DESIGN, THE ONE TRAP: do NOT define BLTruthAt as TruthAt (tr phi). That makes the bridge trivially true and the soundness theorem vacuous as a claim about BL, leaving thm:TM-soundness still without a real counterpart. The semantics must be defined natively on BLFormula and the bridge PROVED.

NOTE THE DEDEKIND ASYMMETRY: soundness_dedekind targets ValidDedekindDense, not ValidDedekind (Soundness.lean:1438-1454), because Dense <= Dedekind makes density and dense_indicator admissible and both are false on Z. The BL-side Dedekind statement must inherit that same target or it will be refutable.

MODULE INVARIANT TO PRESERVE OR AMEND DELIBERATELY: BaseLanguage.lean and Formula.lean:48 currently state that nothing under FormalSystem/BaseLanguage/ imports anything from FormalSystem/Semantics/. Deliverable 1 breaks that invariant by design. Either place Semantics.lean outside BaseLanguage/ or amend the invariant explicitly in both docstrings -- do not leave it silently false.

ACCEPTANCE: all four soundness theorems and the bridge sorry-free, #print axioms exactly [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], lake build green, and scripts/check-module-invariants.sh still ALL PASSED.

### 483. Route1 restricted applyrule emitted time mem
- **Effort**: 3-5 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [481_discharge_or_replace_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed_residual/reports/02_spawn-analysis.md]
- **Plan**: [483_route1_restricted_applyrule_emitted_time_mem/plans/01_route1-restricted-time-sweep.md]
- **Summary**: [483_route1_restricted_applyrule_emitted_time_mem/summaries/01_route1-restricted-time-sweep-summary.md]

**Description**: Decide the OrdTimesKnown/UniverseClosedAt shape mismatch blocking task 481's Phases 6-7, by attempting Route 1 ONLY: a re-derivation of applyRule_emitted_time_mem (FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean) restricted to the rules reachable on a boxFree + untl/snce-free branch -- the same fragment task 481's section D4 already operates on. Route 1 is the cheaper of the two available options and is currently unattempted.

Starting evidence for why Route 1 is believed cheap (from task 481's Phase 5 'what is needed' analysis, to be verified rather than re-derived from scratch): (1) on this fragment, the linearity stage yields .splitOrdered, and hence there is no unordered successor at all to reason about in that case; (2) the seriality stage emits at the trigger's own label, not a fresh one; (3) orderTrichotomy's fires guard demands a someFuture-shaped formula already on the branch (someFuture phi = untl top phi), which a boxFree/untl/snce-free branch structurally cannot carry. Together these three observations suggest that on this restricted fragment, the case analysis applyRule_emitted_time_mem performs may never reach the branch that actually needs OrdTimesKnown b ord -- but this has not been checked rule-by-rule and must be verified as real proof work, not assumed.

OUT OF SCOPE -- do not start under this task: Route 2, an Ord-flavoured UniverseClosedAt and DifficultyBounded, cascading through roughly twenty theorem restatements down to buildTableauAt (the _at, _selfGuarded, and _fixed families). This is an interface redesign and is explicitly deferred pending the outcome of Route 1. Do not begin any part of it as part of this task, even if Route 1 fails.

A negative result is a valid, complete deliverable. If the restricted re-derivation cannot be made to work -- i.e., if some rule reachable on the boxFree/untl/snce-free fragment genuinely still needs OrdTimesKnown b ord to prove applyRule_emitted_time_mem's conclusion -- record that finding with evidence (the specific rule, the specific configuration that requires the hypothesis, and why the fragment restriction does not exclude it) as a C9 register amendment. The C9 register in MintBound.lean currently stands at exactly 24 entries (task 481 amended entries 11 and 21 for the parent residual without adding a 25th); prefer amending an existing entry -- most likely 11 or 21, or the D4 boundary block's own dedicated boundary note -- over adding a 25th entry. Do not treat 'prove applyRule_emitted_time_mem restricted to this fragment' as the only acceptable outcome; a well-evidenced negative result closes this task exactly as completely as a positive one.

Success condition: if Route 1 succeeds (the restricted re-derivation goes through without needing OrdTimesKnown b ord), continue by checking whether task 481's Phase 6 (universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional and the terminus restatement) and Phase 7 (non-vacuity for that terminus) are now reachable as originally written in task 481's plan (specs/481_discharge_or_replace_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed_residual/plans/01_sharpen-replace-labelclosed-residual.md). State explicitly, in this task's summary, whether Phases 6 and 7 are now reachable and, if so, whether landing them should happen as a resumption of task 481 or as a further follow-up task.

Context on recent file state -- do not re-derive, and beware stale line numbers: MintBound.lean is now approximately 14,100+ lines. Task 481 landed a section C11 refutation family and a section D4 (commit ee0fe12a0); task 462 (now completed) landed a section D5 discharging MintPaysForTimeFixed at a nonempty universe under not (FrameClass.Dense <= fc) (commits 2dac7b35f..dc090921e). Any line numbers cited in task 481's plan, report, or summary predate task 462's D5 insertion and must be re-located by declaration name, not by line number. Read task 481's plan '#### Reasoned Exclusions' table and section D4's boundary block, plus reports/01_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed-verdict.md and summaries/01_sharpen-replace-labelclosed-residual-summary.md, before starting.

Acceptance criteria: lake build green; no regression to any check-module-invariants.sh check currently passing; either (a) the restricted re-derivation of applyRule_emitted_time_mem is proved and Phase 6/7 reachability is explicitly assessed and stated, or (b) a negative result is recorded as a C9 register amendment naming the precise rule and configuration that still requires OrdTimesKnown b ord on this fragment.

### 482. Discharge proof extraction completeness
- **Effort**: large
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 412

**Description**: CLASSIFICATION: OPEN MATHEMATICS, multi-month. This MUST NOT be re-described as engineering, and must not be scheduled or budgeted as a routine task.

TARGET: eliminate `.extractionFailed` as a live outcome of `decide` on a genuinely closed tableau. Currently `verifyProof` is `fun _ _ => true` (`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/ProofExtraction.lean:345`, honestly commented, misleadingly named) and no theorem establishes that a closed tableau ALWAYS yields an extractable Hilbert-system derivation. `ProofExtraction.lean` has zero theorems today (re-confirmed at task 468 realignment time, 2026-08-25).

WHAT THIS REQUIRES: the missing refutation induction (`allClosed → Derivable`, the content that would live under `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Refutation/` -- this directory does not exist today, zero files, re-confirmed 2026-08-25) is a PREREQUISITE owned by task 412, which already targets exactly this induction (`allClosed_derivable`). This task is sequenced AFTER 412 rather than folded into 412's acceptance criteria as an additional corollary, precisely so the research problem is not hidden behind 412's engineering-shaped description -- see the planner's decision recorded in task 468's implementation plan (`specs/468_realign_task_programme_from_proof_state_audit/plans/01_programme-realignment-execution.md`, "Planner decisions taken here" item 1). Task 412's own description carries a one-line REVISE naming this task as the owner of `.extractionFailed` elimination.

DEPENDENCIES: `[412]`.

FILE SCOPE: `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/ProofExtraction.lean`,
`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Refutation/` (does not yet exist -- this task or a predecessor may need to create it).

DO NOT schedule this as an independent parallel effort that would redundantly re-derive the refutation induction 412 already targets -- consume 412's `allClosed_derivable` once it lands.

ACCEPTANCE: `.extractionFailed` is unreachable on a genuinely closed tableau (stated and proved as a corollary of `allClosed_derivable` or equivalent); `lake build` green; no regression to any currently-passing check-module-invariants.sh check; `verifyProof` either proved correct against the new theorem or replaced by an implementation whose correctness the new theorem certifies.

PROVENANCE: specced by task 468's realignment (report `specs/468_realign_task_programme_from_proof_state_audit/reports/02_stage1-verification-and-programme-realignment.md` §5, new-task-spec-2), itself descended from `specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md` amendment 10b's surviving ADD-list item, per R4.

### 481. Discharge or replace unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed residual
- **Effort**: large
- **Status**: [BLOCKED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 434, Task 483
- **Research**: [481_discharge_or_replace_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed_residual/reports/01_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed-verdict.md]
- **Plan**: [481_discharge_or_replace_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed_residual/plans/01_sharpen-replace-labelclosed-residual.md]
- **Summary**: [481_discharge_or_replace_unorderedsuccessorlabelclosed_residual/summaries/01_sharpen-replace-labelclosed-residual-summary.md]

**Description**: CLASSIFICATION: genuinely open -- the predicate is refuted as stated, so this is a repair-or-replace problem, not routine discharge. This is the FIFTH termination residual; the four-residual framing used elsewhere in this programme (`UniverseClosed`, `DifficultyBounded`/`StepLengthBounded`, `MintPaysForTime`, `PostBlockingSettles`) is WRONG and must be corrected wherever it recurs.

TARGET: `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` (`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean:6199`) is carried as a live hypothesis by `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse` (`:6215`) and has an in-tree refutation at `:6238` (`¬ UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc freshWorldLabels`) -- the same shape of problem `DifficultyBounded` presented before `StepLengthBounded` replaced it.

WHAT TO DO -- determine which of three outcomes applies:
(a) the predicate can be discharged at the frame classes/settings the surviving terminus theorems actually need (distinct from the setting `:6238` refutes it in -- check precisely which); or
(b) it needs a `StepLengthBounded`-style weaker replacement, analogous to the `DifficultyBounded` -> `StepLengthBounded` repair pattern already in this file; or
(c) it is unclosable as stated and needs a C9 register entry (the file already has 24 such entries; this would be the 25th) plus an explicit statement of which theorem still carries it and at which frame classes.

A C9 REGISTER ENTRY IS A VALID, COMPLETE DELIVERABLE for this task -- do not treat "prove it" as the only acceptable outcome.

SEQUENCING NOTE (direct from `specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md` amendment 10e, re-affirmed by task 468's realignment): task 462 targets `MintPaysForTimeFixed` discharge at a NONEMPTY UNIVERSE, which is the same setting `:6238`'s refutation applies in. If this task and 462 are not sequenced, 462 risks either duplicating the discovery of the refutation or, worse, building on an implicit assumption that this residual is harmless. This task should run BEFORE OR ALONGSIDE 462.

DEPENDENCIES: `[434]` (established the residual set this belongs to). Do NOT fold into 465 (the mechanical restatement-family task) -- 465 is explicitly scoped as "a one-line application of its family root" for SETTLED residuals; this residual is not settled, so folding it in would either force 465 to do research work outside its charter or produce a restatement of an unsettled predicate, which is exactly the kind of premature-closure risk this whole realignment exists to prevent.

VERIFIED at task-468 realignment time (2026-08-25): none of tasks 462, 463, 464, 465 mentions the symbol `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` in its live description.

ACCEPTANCE: one of outcomes (a)/(b)/(c) above is reached and recorded; `lake build` green; no regression to any currently-passing check-module-invariants.sh check.

PROVENANCE: specced by task 468's realignment (report `specs/468_realign_task_programme_from_proof_state_audit/reports/02_stage1-verification-and-programme-realignment.md` §5, new-task-spec-3), itself descended from `specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md` amendment 10e.

### 476. Box faithful small model theorem
- **Effort**: large
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 475

**Description**: THE BOX-FAITHFUL SMALL-MODEL THEOREM.

CLASSIFICATION: OPEN MATHEMATICS. MULTI-MONTH. This is a genuine research problem in the same
category as the audit's R4 "semantic FMP" entry. IT MAY NOT BE RE-DESCRIBED AS ENGINEERING, AND IT
MAY NOT BE MERGED INTO THE BILASSO WIRING TASK OR THE CARRIER-NORMALIZATION TASK. Merging is
precisely how a research problem gets hidden behind an engineering description, and this task
exists partly to prevent that.

DO NOT BEGIN before the BiLasso wiring task and the carrier-normalization task (task 475) are
landed. Those two have standalone value; this one does not, and its cost is dominated by a problem
a two-day literature check might refute outright.

=== LITERATURE GATE -- RUN FIRST, AND IT IS EMPOWERED TO STOP THE TASK ===

Acquire Gabbay, Kurucz, Wolter, Zakharyaschev, *Many-Dimensional Modal Logics* (2003) and read its
temporal-products chapter. IF the two-dimensional `Until`/`Since` case is recorded there as
undecidable or as lacking the finite model property, THIS TASK IS REFUTED and must be REPORTED AS
SUCH rather than attempted. A negative result here is as valuable as a positive one and would
redirect the whole decidability front.

What is already firm from a prior search: products of THREE OR MORE modal logics are undecidable,
with no logic between K x K x K and S5 x S5 x S5 decidable, and S5 x S5 x S5 lacks the finite model
property. What is NOT settled: the two-dimensional case with `Until`/`Since`, which is what this
logic is closest to. Note that TM is in any case NOT a full product -- its second dimension is the
path space of a graph, not an arbitrary set of runs -- so a product-logic result would be evidence,
not a decision.

=== THE TARGET ===

Build `cands : Formula -> List IntPresentation` and prove

    not (ValidDiscrete phi) -> exists P in cands phi, exists w, SatAtState P w phi.neg

This is the SINGLE remaining obligation for decidability of `ValidDiscrete`. Everything else is
already compiled: given this hypothesis, `check`-over-`cands` is equivalent to `ValidDiscrete phi`
and `decidable_of_iff` reads the `Decidable` instance off it. There is no bridge theorem, no
transfer lemma, no enumeration over `Atom`, and no `Fin n`-from-`Finite` extraction anywhere in the
assembly; `check_correct` is the FINAL step.

=== THE CONSTRUCTION (the tractable part) ===

Build `cands phi` from the CLOSURE-TYPE SPACE: subsets of `subformulaClosure phi` satisfying the
local Hintikka conditions, with `step` given by `LocalCoherent`'s `untl`/`snce` unfolding clauses
(`BiLasso/Annotation.lean` already states them, and they relate the label at `t` to the label at
`t` plus-or-minus one only -- i.e. they ARE an adjacency relation), and the valuation read off the
state by deciding atom membership. Every ingredient is `Finset`/`Bool` data with `DecidableEq`.
Two real obligations, neither research-grade:

  1. `fwd`/`bwd` SERIALITY OF THE TYPE GRAPH. Not free: a Hintikka type may have no locally
     coherent successor, forcing an ITERATED PRUNING to a maximal serial subgraph. Standard,
     bounded, fiddly.
  2. INDEXING. `IntPresentation` demands `Fin card` specifically, so the type `Finset` must be
     listed and indexed. Mechanical.

Estimate for this part alone: two to four weeks.

DO NOT instead try "bound `card` by some `presentationBound phi`, then enumerate the presentations
up to that bound". That does not typecheck as stated: `IntPresentation.val : Atom -> Fin card ->
Bool` is a function on the `Infinite` type `Atom`, so presentations of a given `card` are not a
finite collection. Closing that would need a valuation-restriction lemma that is not in the tree.
The formula-indexed candidate list sidesteps the problem rather than solving it.

=== THE CRUX: BOX-FAITHFULNESS (the research part) ===

The `box` clause of `TruthAt` quantifies universally over ALL total histories. Two landed facts
make this a GLOBAL modality rather than a local one:

  - `Truth.box_const` (`Semantics/Truth.lean`): box truth is independent of both the history and
    the time. Its own docstring: "a model has one finite set of box facts, computed once."
  - `Extension.occurrence` (`cor:occurrence`): every state occurs at every time in some total
    history.

That collapse is why `BoxOracleSound P bx` types `bx` as `Formula -> Bool` -- one `Bool` per
formula, per model. It is also the obstruction:

  The box facts of the SOURCE model M and of the TARGET presentation P are each global constants
  of their own model, and they need not agree. P admits every path of its graph. The subgraph of
  types realized in M still generates paths that M does not realize, and along such a path a
  `box chi` true in M can fail. When it fails, the type-map image is no longer a `LocalCoherent`
  annotation, and the transfer breaks.

Restricting `cands phi` to realized-type subgraphs does NOT by itself close this: the subshift
generated by the realized edges properly contains the realized paths. So the residue is a genuine
BOX-FAITHFUL small-model theorem -- in effect a bounded-model property for LTL(Until, Since) over
bi-infinite paths of a graph, PLUS a universal path quantifier over the whole structure.

Is it true? Almost certainly -- the shape is the classical automata-theoretic bounded-model
setting, and the analogous results (CTL*-style satisfiability, LTL with a universal modality) are
decidable with finite/bounded model properties. Is it in reach? Not routinely. Neither Mathlib nor
this tree carries omega-automata, Buchi complementation, or any language-inclusion machinery, so a
Lean proof must be hand-rolled.

=== WHAT TO REUSE ===

`BiLasso/GoodCycle.lean`'s good-cycle argument, `cycleBound`, and `exists_annot_of_truth` are
exactly the fulfilment machinery a hand-rolled proof would reuse. Be clear-eyed that they operate
INSIDE a presentation, not across the model boundary, which is the whole difficulty.

=== DO NOT PROMISE A CHOICE-FREE RESULT ===

`wlem_of_spherical` (`Tests/BimodalTest/Semantics/SphericalFiniteAxiomTest.lean`) derives weak
excluded middle from `Spherical R` at the finite carrier `Bool` over `D = ZZ`, from
`[propext, Quot.sound]` alone. So NO finite-carrier frame with an arbitrarily shaped relation can
be choice-free, on any route. The cost is already paid by `IntPresentation.toTaskFrame`. Any spec
promising choice-freedom here is promising something proved impossible. Note the separate
distinction: `instDecidableSatAtState` COMPUTES (kernel-evaluated `#guard`s prove it) while
measuring `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Computability and choice-freedom are different
properties.

### 465. Complete terminus restatement family
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 462, Task 463, Task 464

**Description**: Complete the terminus restatement family at the repaired residuals. Task 433's Phase 6 landed EIGHT of the twenty-two restatements -- the four family roots and their four caller-facing seed forms -- and recorded the remaining FOURTEEN as a Reasoned Exclusion with the recipe written down: each is a `_lengthBudget` / `signedUniverse` substitution, "a one-line application of its family root".

This is deliberately MECHANICAL work with the recipe already recorded. Its value is uniformity: a caller reaching for a `_lengthBudget` or `signedUniverse` form of a repaired terminus should find it landed rather than having to re-derive it, and a half-populated family is a trap for a future reader who assumes an absent member is absent for a reason.

SCOPE: read Phase 6's Reasoned Exclusions section in specs/433_discharge_postblockingsettles_residual/plans/01_postblockingsettles-refute-or-prove.md for the enumerated list and the recipe. The family roots and existing members are the `buildTableauAt_isSome_*` declarations in MintBound.lean (the `_at`, `_selfGuarded`, `_fixed` and `_run` families, roughly :6308-:12240). Land the fourteen missing members following the naming convention the file already uses; do not invent a new convention.

WHY THIS RUNS LAST: it restates termini at the repaired residuals, so it must run after the residuals themselves are settled. If 462, 463 or 464 changes a predicate's shape or sheds a hypothesis, the restatements must reflect the settled form -- doing this work earlier would mean doing it twice. Before starting, RE-DERIVE the list of missing members from the file as it then stands rather than trusting the count of fourteen recorded here: earlier tasks may have landed some, or added new family roots.

PROHIBITED: no `sorry`; additive only; do not alter any previously-landed declaration; do not edit Fuel.lean, Saturation.lean or Tableau.lean; axioms within {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; full `lake build` green. If any of the fourteen turns out NOT to be a one-line application -- i.e. the recipe does not actually apply -- STOP on that member, record why, and do not force it; a member that needs real mathematics belongs in its own task, not smuggled in here.

Dependencies: 462, 463, 464 -- all three, so that the restatements are made against a settled set of residuals rather than a moving one.

### 464. Gappotential density measure component
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 462, Task 463

**Description**: Design and land `gapPotential`, the density coordinate of the termination measure. This is the one genuinely OPEN MATHEMATICAL question remaining on the totality terminus; it is research, not plumbing, and should be run with --lit.

THE PROBLEM, stated exactly. `densityRule` mints a fresh time while lying OUTSIDE BOTH `freshLabelRules` AND `selfGuardRules`. Consequently no disjunct of the current measure moves at a `densityRule` step, FOR ANY sigma WHATSOEVER. This has been open since C9 register entry 17 named it, and task 434's Phase 8 records the current state bluntly: `gapPotential` "remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing". Because `densityRule` is `denseRules`-gated, this blocks a nonempty `MintPaysForTimeFixed` discharge at `.Dense` and `.Dedekind` frame classes specifically; every frame class needs `gapPotential` for a fully general result.

SHAPE SUGGESTED BY PRIOR WORK (a starting point, NOT a specification to follow blindly): task 434 records the expectation that `gapPotential` is indexed by `U x U` and `denseRules`-gated. Validate or refute that shape as part of the research; if a different indexing is correct, say so and justify it.

HARD REQUIREMENT -- PRESERVATION ACROSS THE IDENTIFICATION ARM. Any candidate component must be preserved across `TimeOrdering.identifyTime`, which can LOWER `ord.timeCount`. This is the same maxTime-lowering mechanism that refuted earlier candidates; see `nextTime_reissues_retired_time` and `reuse_driven_through_engine`, and task 436's oriented-arm re-gate (`orientedGate*` family, :8592-8788) for how the analogous obstacle was handled for the self-guard component. A component that pays at `densityRule` steps but is destroyed by the identification arm is not a solution.

REFUTED ROUTES -- C9 register entries 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24. Read them ALL in full before designing anything. In particular entry 14 forbids BOTH (1) re-indexing `mintPotential` on `freshTimeRules` instead of `freshLabelRules` -- refuted by `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`, whose match has exactly eight arms so the three added columns are permanently false -- and (2) dropping disjunct 1's cardinality conjunct in favour of the ordering-rank conjunct alone -- refuted by `splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt` plus `mintPaysForTime_rank_repair_false`. Neither may be re-attempted.

LITERATURE. Run with --lit against the sub-index curated for this line of work, drawing specifically on: venema_2001 section 5 (interval-based temporal logic) for the density/gap-guarded component itself; caleiro_2013 sections 6-7 (mosaic-method decidability for combined tense-and-modal logics) as a structural analogue for a combined-logic termination measure; gerth_1995 and baier_katoen_2008 (closure-set LTL tableau termination) as a model for a measure over an evolving, non-monotonically-changing time set; and massacci_2000 for rule-bounding technique.

DONE MEANS EITHER: (a) `gapPotential` defined, its payment at `densityRule` steps proved, its preservation across `identifyTime` proved, integrated into the measure, and a nonempty `MintPaysForTimeFixed` discharge extended to `.Dense` and `.Dedekind`; OR (b) a machine-checked impossibility result showing no such component exists at the current measure's shape, with the obstruction identified precisely and a C9 entry recording it. Outcome (b) is a genuine and valuable result, NOT a failure -- this repo's practice is that a proved refutation ranks with a proof, and several of this measure's real advances came from refutations.

PROHIBITED: no `sorry`, no vacuous or false predicate, no weakening presented as a repair (a direction lemma is a GATE, not a nicety -- C9 entry 7 exists because that mistake was made once); do not edit Fuel.lean, Saturation.lean or Tableau.lean (md5-pinned frozen); additive only in MintBound.lean; axioms within {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; full `lake build` green.

Dependencies: 462 is a REAL SEMANTIC dependency -- the engine-level assembly is what makes a per-rule payment usable at the successor, and `gapPotential`'s payment needs the same threading. 463 is a file_scope SERIALIZATION edge only (both edit MintBound.lean), with no mathematical content.

### 463. Postblockingsettlesrun verdict at terminus fuel
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 462, Task 433

**Description**: Decide `PostBlockingSettlesRun fc (mintAwareFuelAt U.card Tmax mintBudget D beta)` -- the narrowed settlement residual task 433 landed -- at the terminus's OWN fuel figure. Nothing currently decides it in either direction, and task 433's C9 register entry 24 exists precisely so the narrowing is not mistaken for a proof.

WHY THIS MATTERS. `PostBlockingSettlesRun` (MintBound.lean:11961) is CARRIED as a hypothesis by the fully-repaired terminus `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget_fixed_run` (:12199), exactly as `ArmSettlement` is. Until it is decided, the repaired terminus rests on an unknown. Task 433 established the surrounding facts but deliberately stopped short of this verdict.

WHAT IS ALREADY DECIDED -- consume, do not repeat:
- `PostBlockingSettles fc` (the unnarrowed form, :5181) is REFUTED: `postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` (false at the `fuel = 0` arm at every frame class) and `postBlockingSettles_fuel_gap_false` / `postBlockingSettles_gap_at_every_fuel` (fuel does not close the gap, at ANY fuel). The witness is `freshWorldBranch = [F(box p)@<0,0>]`: `.boxNeg` mints a fresh world, so `expandOnceNoFresh` skips it and reports `.saturated` while `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` reports it.
- `PostBlockingSettlesAt fc` (:11539) holds OUTRIGHT for every `fc` (`postBlockingSettlesAt_holds`, :11721) -- but the bridge from `saturateBlocked ... = some (.inr (satBr, satOrd))` to its antecedents does NOT go through, because at `fuel = 0` that equation holds at every branch while carrying no saturation information (`labelFreeSaturatedExit_not_of_saturateBlocked_inr`).
- Task 433 PROVED that the only bridge shape that typechecks carries a hypothesis that is itself refutable (it composes with the settlement lemma to give the refuted `PostBlockingSettles fc`). Do NOT re-attempt that bridge; it is a weakening dressed as a repair.

STRUCTURE THIS AS A REFUTE-FIRST GATE with a BINARY verdict, in the style tasks 432, 433 and 436 used successfully. Both outcomes are first-class deliverables:
- TRUE: `PostBlockingSettlesRun` holds at the terminus's own fuel figure -- discharge it, and the repaired terminus sheds a hypothesis.
- FALSE: it is refutable at that figure -- land the machine-checked refutation with its witness, record a C9 entry, and name the minimal further narrowing as the next step. A proved refutation here is as valuable as a proof and MUST NOT be treated as failure.

EMPIRICAL WARNING FROM TASK 433. Across fourteen formula shapes, four frame classes and three fuel figures, `buildTableauAt`'s own guard NEVER fired -- the threaded tracker and the recomputed `armTracker` agreed everywhere -- so no probed run exercised the post-blocking arm at all. That is a fact about the probe's reach, not about the residual, but it means this path is essentially untested empirically. Do not treat "no counterexample found by probing" as evidence of truth; the verdict must be proved either way, and if the honest answer is "undecided by the means available", say so explicitly with evidence rather than guessing.

PROHIBITED: do not discharge via `ArmSettlement` (proved strictly too weak: `resolveOpenArm` tests `findClosure satBr` before its saturation test, `buildTableauAt` does not); do not edit Saturation.lean, Tableau.lean or Fuel.lean (md5-pinned frozen) -- use only their existing public interface; do not re-attempt anything in the C9 register; no `sorry`, no vacuous discharge. Sorry-free, axiom-free, additive only, full `lake build` green.

Dependencies: 462, as a file_scope SERIALIZATION edge only (both tasks edit MintBound.lean). There is no mathematical dependency on 462 -- this task's content is independent of the minting measure and may be reasoned about immediately.

### 461. Acquire Goldblatt 1989 'Varieties of complex algebras' (Annals of Pure and Applied Logic)
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: general
- **Topic**: literature
- **Dependencies**: Task 460
- **Research**: [461_acquire_goldblatt_1989_varieties_of_complex_algebras/reports/01_acquisition-feasibility.md]

**Description**: SCOPE 8 acquisition gap identified by task 457's research and re-confirmed at implementation time: this paper is absent from both the ~/Projects/Literature corpus and the Zotero library, and is named as a prerequisite by other tasks in this repo working on the Jonsson-Tarski representation theorem. Note: goldblatt_2003 already present in the corpus is a DIFFERENT paper (Erdos Graphs Resolve Fine's Canonicity Problem) -- do not conflate the two. Needed: locate and acquire a copy of Goldblatt 1989 (Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 44, pp. 173-242), add it to Zotero, then run a normal /literature ingest.

### 433. Discharge postblockingsettles residual
- **Effort**: 6-10 hours
- **Status**: [PARTIAL]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 432, Task 434
- **Research**:
  - [428_engine_totality_at_a_quantified_branch_budget/reports/05_spawn-analysis.md]
  - [433_discharge_postblockingsettles_residual/reports/01_spawn-inherited-research.md]
- **Plan**: [433_discharge_postblockingsettles_residual/plans/01_postblockingsettles-refute-or-prove.md]
- **Summary**: [433_discharge_postblockingsettles_residual/summaries/01_postblockingsettles-summary.md]

**Description**: Discharge `PostBlockingSettles fc`, defined at FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean:4344, one of the four residual hypotheses on the totality terminus `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget` (MintBound.lean:4416). It states that the post-blocking pass leaves a branch the blocking-aware saturation test certifies -- i.e. `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith satBr satOrd fc (blockedTimes satBr satOrd fc (armTracker satBr)) = none` whenever `saturateBlocked ob fuel oOrd fc = some (.inr (satBr, satOrd))`. It subsumes `resolveOpenArm`'s own `none` arm via `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles` (MintBound.lean:4354) -- `ArmSettlement` alone is proved strictly too weak (`resolveOpenArm` tests `findClosure satBr` before its saturation test; `buildTableauAt` does not), so do not attempt to discharge via `ArmSettlement` instead. The relevant definitions are frozen (md5-pinned) in Saturation.lean (`saturateBlocked`, :431) and Tableau.lean (`blockedTimes`, :2104; `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith`, :2115) -- do not edit either file; the residual's own docstring states the gap ('whether the fuel-vs-condition gap can be closed by fuel alone') is exactly what Saturation.lean leaves open using only its existing public interface. Done means: either (a) a proof of `PostBlockingSettles fc` for the frame classes the terminus is meant to be used at, using only the public interface of the frozen files, landed sorry-free and axiom-free with `lake build` green; or (b), if (a) turns out to be genuinely impossible without touching the frozen files, a return to [BLOCKED] with the specific counterexample or obstruction found, analogous to the parent task's own refutation-driven repairs (e.g. `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`, MintBound.lean:1217) -- do not paper over with a vacuous definition (`lean4.md`'s Vacuous Definitions prohibition applies). This task's own residual work -- deciding PostBlockingSettlesRun at the terminus's own fuel figure, and completing the terminus restatement family -- has moved downstream to tasks 463 and 465 respectively; do not re-attempt those here.

### 430. Semantic lift and track a assembly valid iff allclosed
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 428, Task 429, Task 411

**Description**: The semantic lift and the Track A assembly. Owns obstruction O4 of the Phase 7.3 deadlock, then delivers what Phase 7.3 of task 165 was for. Grounding: specs/165_establish_semantic_finite_model_property/reports/09_phase7-deadlock-blocker-research.md.

THIS TASK CARRIES THE WORK MOVED OUT OF TASK 165's PHASE 7.3. Task 165 terminated with Phase 7 scoped to what it delivered (the truth lemma and Track A's conditional results); 7.3 -- `valid_iff_allClosed` and the `Decidable` instances -- was moved here rather than closed, because it is blocked on prerequisites no task owned.

O4 HAS TWO DISTINCT PIECES, per Verified/Decidable.lean:3062-3067: "It is not yet `valid_iff_allClosed` (7.3), which additionally needs the fuel/termination side and the truth-lemma gate, and it says nothing about the two rules scheduled outside `allRulesForFC` -- `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity` run as stages 2 and 3 of `expandOnce` and need their own obligations at the point where `expandOnce`, rather than `applyRule`, is the object."

(a) Two more `RuleSound`-analogues at the `expandOnce` level, for `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity`. These are deliberately outside `allRulesForFC`, so `ruleSound_of_mem_allRulesForFC` (landed, 34/34) does NOT cover them.
(b) THE SEMANTIC LIFT: the induction lifting single-step satisfiability preservation to the whole recursion, so that `.allClosed` yields a contradiction. This is the LARGER of the two and is comparable in weight to a landed sub-phase, not to a wrapper. Naming it inside "the two outside rules" understates it.

THEN, and only after (a), (b) and both predecessors: `valid_iff_allClosed` plus the four `Decidable` instances for validity over Base, Dense, Discrete and Dedekind.

WHAT IS ALREADY LANDED (do not re-prove): the rule half is done -- `ruleSound_of_mem_allRulesForFC` is a single landed induction over `mem_allRulesForFC_iff`, ledger complete at 34/34, from task 165 Phase 7.2.

PLAN AGAINST SIX ROWS, NOT EIGHT: the truth-lemma gate hypothesis hTW is discharged on SIX accepted TemporalWitnessProbe rows (A, B, C, D, E, F), not the historical eight -- rows I and K left when the PASSIVE arms of untlNeg/snceNeg were retired. See the banner at the head of Tests/BimodalTest/TemporalWitnessProbe.lean.

DO NOT write a conditional `valid_iff_allClosed` carrying hTW as an explicit hypothesis. Correctness.lean:98-105 refuses exactly this shape, and the O4(b) hypothesis would BE the conclusion's forward direction, making the theorem vacuous. Four vacuous theorems were deleted in 165's Phase 8; do not land a fifth.

DONE WHEN: `valid_iff_allClosed` and the four `Decidable` validity instances are landed unconditionally, sorry-free and axiom-clean outside Boneyard, lake build green.

### 429. Repair truth lemma side conditions boxanchored and temporalwitness
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 428

**Description**: Repair the truth-lemma side conditions. Owns obstructions O2 and O3 of the Phase 7.3 deadlock recorded in specs/165_establish_semantic_finite_model_property/reports/09_phase7-deadlock-blocker-research.md. THIS IS THE TASK WITH GENUINE OPEN MATHEMATICS IN IT and should be budgeted accordingly.

READ FIRST: specs/418_*/artifacts/boxanchored-finding.md -- it carries the measurement, the full carrier list, and the repair options. Then TruthLemma.lean:399-404 and BoxSaturation.lean:430-435, :574-580.

O2 -- `hBA` (`boxAnchoredCheck`) is no longer dischargeable on multi-world branches. BoxSaturation.lean:430-435: the two copy blocks "have since been removed as unsound ... They were the ONLY route by which T(G phi)/T(H phi) could reach a freshly minted world ... `boxAnchoredCheck` is therefore expected to compute `false` on multi-world branches now." :574-580: "a caller can no longer expect to discharge that hypothesis from a real run." TruthLemma.lean:399-404 names the repair as "an open design decision with its own soundness obligations" and lists THREE candidate routes: (a) propagate T(box phi) itself; (b) copy T(G phi)/T(H phi) only when box-derived; (c) restructure the `box` case to need no anchor.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: this was caused by task 418 (completed) removing a GENUINE UNSOUNDNESS. It is the cost of a correct fix, not a regression to revert. TruthLemma.lean:404 says "Do NOT reinstate the removed copies." Any repair must re-establish the anchor WITHOUT reinstating them.

O3 -- `hTW` (`temporalWitnessCheck`) is no longer dischargeable on any branch carrying a negative until with a known future time. TemporalWitnessProbe.lean:66-73: `untlNegFuture` demands F(event) at every known future time of every negative until; the PASSIVE arm's branch 1 was the ONLY producer of `not event` at an EXISTING time; that arm was retired as unsound (user-authorized rank 2), so the producer is gone. Measured cost: fourteen probe rows moved check=true -> check=false; the accepted set went from EIGHT rows to SIX (rows A, B, C, D, E, F; I and K left). :86-88: "it was already `false` on the branches the engine actually builds. What it removes is the last set of hand-built branches on which the hypothesis was discharged."

DO NOT REOPEN (settled by 165): guardWitnessed in any variant; restoring sat_untl_neg / sat_snce_neg (they are FALSE against the current engine, not merely unproved); reinstating the retired PASSIVE arms or the removed box copy blocks.

GOAL: choose among the three documented BoxAnchored repair routes and land it with its soundness obligations discharged; and re-establish a producer for `not event` at existing future times. Both must hold on branches the engine ACTUALLY builds, measured by the probes, not on hand-built branches.

DONE WHEN: `boxAnchoredCheck` and `temporalWitnessCheck` are dischargeable on real engine output for the relevant branch classes, evidenced by probe rows moving back to check=true; no unsound copy block or retired arm is reinstated; lake build green.
REALIGNMENT ADDENDUM (task 468, 2026-08-25) -- RECOMMENDED ROUTE, NAMED UP FRONT: of the three O2
repair routes listed above, route (a) -- propagate T(box phi) itself to the fresh world -- is the
RECOMMENDED route (per specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md amendment 10a and the box-anchor
artifact's own §5), so a dispatch need not re-derive the recommendation from
boxanchored-finding.md each time. It follows the S5 axiom-4/5 pattern, carries its own RuleSound
obligation, and has named fuel/termination consequences that Fuel.lean's bounds and the
subformula property must absorb -- all as already detailed in that artifact. Route (b) remains
available but reduces to route (a)'s obligation once branch provenance is tracked, per the
artifact. Route (c) stays recorded as CLOSED AS FORMULATED (boxGridCheck fails for the same
structural reason the anchor does, so weakening only the anchor buys nothing) -- do not
re-attempt it. This addendum names a recommendation; it does not narrow the task's own account of
all three routes and their obligations above, which stands as written.

**Description**: Engine totality at a quantified branch budget. Owns obstruction O1 of the Phase 7.3 deadlock recorded in specs/165_establish_semantic_finite_model_property/reports/09_phase7-deadlock-blocker-research.md section "The four obstructions" (read it first; do not re-derive the refutation).

THE REFUTED THEOREM, SETTLED: `buildTableau_isSome` in unconditional form is FALSE, not merely unproved, and is on a do-not-re-attempt register (165's plan 01_tableau-decidability-two-track.md:1405-1420, :1489-1493). The refutation is a property of the engine SIGNATURE, not a proof difficulty: `buildTableau` (Saturation.lean:928-951) calls `expandBranchWithFuel` at the default `maxBranches := 50000` (Saturation.lean:590), whose first line is `if branchesUsed >= maxBranches then none` (:594). A formula exploring more than 50000 branches returns `none` at ANY fuel whatsoever. Independently, `buildTableau`'s last arm returns `none` on a still-unsaturated branch (:950). Neither is fuel exhaustion, so no fuel figure rules them out. DO NOT attempt the unconditional form.

WHAT LANDED INSTEAD, and why it is unusable as-is: Verified/Termination/Fuel.lean:1587-1598 carries two hypotheses -- `(hP : NoSplit P fc)` and `(hbud : branchesUsed + fuel <= maxBranches)`. `NoSplit` excludes impPos, orPos, untlPos, untlNeg, sncePos, snceNeg, orderTrichotomy and every frame-class-gated splitting rule, i.e. it holds only on non-branching runs. 165's plan:1467-1468 records "Residual 2 (branching arms) -- isolated, not discharged."

GOAL: add a `maxBranches`-parameterised entry point ALONGSIDE `buildTableau` -- an ADDITION, never an edit to the existing default, because `maxBranches = 50000` is a deliberate runtime guard -- and prove totality against a quantified budget. Target shape:

  theorem buildTableau_isSome_of_budget (phi : Formula) (fc : FrameClass)
      (maxBranches : Nat) (hmb : <bound in phi> <= maxBranches) :
      (buildTableauAt phi (soundFuel' phi) fc maxBranches).isSome = true

THREE SUB-OBLIGATIONS:
1. Discharge the branching-arm residual that `NoSplit` currently hypothesises (Fuel.lean:1587, Saturation.lean:661-664, :686-689).
2. Supply the missing WORLD-COUNT dimension. 165's plan:1484-1488: "T1 bounds formulas and T2 bounds times; neither bounds worlds ... as defined, `soundFuel' = 2*n*2^(2n)` has no world factor at all." A branch bound that ignores worlds cannot bound branches.
3. Establish the `<bound in phi> <= maxBranches` side condition in a form callers can actually discharge.

COORDINATION: overlaps task 426's hypothesis (b) on the same file (Fuel.lean). Sequence with 426 or merge; do not both edit Fuel.lean concurrently. Task 412 consumes this theorem in place of the refuted `buildTableau_isSome`.

DONE WHEN: the budget-parameterised totality theorem is landed sorry-free with no `NoSplit` hypothesis, lake build green, and the world dimension is either supplied or its absence is proved harmless.

RETARGET DECISION (user-approved, post-research): the specified unconditional target shape is refuted (see reports/01_budget-totality-refuted-and-repair.md). Task WIDENED to own the validated certificate repair: swap findUnexpanded -> findUnexpandedUnblocked at resolveOpenArm's two decision points, discharge the accompanying soundness obligation on what .hasOpen certifies (shared with O2/O3), lift the proved saturateBlocked_isSome asset, close the world dimension via worldFuel'/WorldWitness, and land the budget-parameterised totality theorem against the repaired engine. The per-path budget finding (maxBranches >= 3*fuel linear invariant) supplies the side condition.

SECOND RETARGET DECISION (user-approved, post-research 03). The per-step framing of Phase 11 cannot be closed: reports/03_phase11-potential-obstruction.md section 4 is a proof about the SHAPE of the argument, not a report of a failed attempt. Route (a) (a lower bound on branch cardinality after identification) is DEAD by definition -- `Branch.identifyTime = (b.map relabel).eraseDups`, so all shrinkage comes from eraseDups and is bounded only by |U|. Route (b) (an independent mint bound) is the APPROVED path.

THE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE IS EXPLICITLY REJECTED BY THE USER: do NOT carry the mint bound as a hypothesis in the shape `hT` has, and do NOT push the discharge obligation onto task 412. Do it the right way.

APPROVED WORK (route (b), ~6-7 phases, comparable in size to everything landed so far):
1. WITNESS PRESERVATION (~3 phases): the eight-rule case analysis of report 03 section 3 step 4, resting on the three lemmas already machine-checked in that report's section 1 (`mem_futureOf_of_mem_constraints`, `mem_pastOf_of_mem_constraints`, `identifyTime_no_collapse`).
2. RESTATEMENT (~1 phase): give `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_budget` an explicit MINT-BUDGET PARAMETER, in the shape `branchesUsed`/`maxBranches` already establishes. This is what converts route (b)'s amortized bound into something the induction can carry; a per-step potential over (b, ord) provably cannot express it (report 03 section 4), and `maxTime` was checked and is not a usable proxy (arm 3 can lower it).
3. AMORTIZED INDUCTION (~2-3 phases): #mints <= 8*|U|; #identifications <= |knownTimes|_0 + #mints; total shrinkage <= #identifications * |U|; #extensions <= |U| + total shrinkage; then the terminus `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget`.

RESEARCH GATE -- MACHINE-CHECK BEFORE PLANNING. Report 03 marks two load-bearing claims UNCERTAIN, and the whole mint bound rests on both:
  (i) section 3 step 4, witness preservation across `.splitOrdered` arm 3 -- ARGUED, NOT MACHINE-CHECKED. The two modal rules are trivial (their witness sits at the same time as `sf`, so identification moves both together); THE SIX TEMPORAL ONES NEED THE REACHABILITY TRANSPORT and were not verified.
  (ii) section 3 step 3, "formulas are never deleted" -- read off the rule shapes, consistent with the landed `expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt` / `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt`, but NOT PROVED.
Machine-check BOTH before any plan is written. This task has twice had a plan rest on an unverified lemma that later turned out FALSE (the unconditional `buildTableau_isSome`; then the `.splitOrdered` cardinality twin). A third occurrence is not acceptable. If witness preservation fails for any temporal rule, ROUTE (b) IS DEAD and that is a THIRD retarget decision requiring human approval -- report it plainly, do not work around it and do not substitute a weaker statement.

PRESERVED, DO NOT RE-PROVE: phases 1-10 of plans/02_lexicographic-splitordered-measure.md are landed, sorry-free, axiom-free, and green repo-wide. Consume those declarations. `buildTableau`, its `fuel := 1000` default, and `expandBranchWithFuel`'s `maxBranches := 50000` default stay BYTE-IDENTICAL. No `NoSplit` reintroduction; no admitted `WorldWitness` or `hT`; no `sorry`; no narrowing a statement into vacuity. The refuted unconditional `buildTableau_isSome` and the refuted `.splitOrdered` cardinality twin stay on the do-not-re-attempt register. `resolveOpenArmCancellable` in CancellableExpansion.lean remains a DECLARED, deliberately-unrepaired out-of-scope divergence. Task 412 must not be planned against `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget` until it lands; the Phase 3 assets (`BudgetedTableau`, `buildTableauAt`, `BudgetedTableau.upgrade`) are available and sorry-free meanwhile.

RESUME SEQUENCE: `/research 428` first (discharge the two uncertain claims above), then `/orchestrate 428`. The stale loop guard from the prior invocation has been removed so a restart gets a fresh cycle budget.
REALIGNMENT ADDENDUM (task 468, 2026-08-25) -- ASSESS-AND-C9-REGISTER ESCAPE CLAUSE FOR THE
SPLIT-ARM FUEL SCALING PROBLEM: the opening "THE REFUTED THEOREM, SETTLED" paragraph above is
unaffected by this addendum and gets a CURRENT verdict on that point -- do NOT touch it.

`Fuel.lean:1595-1610` documents that fuel adequate for a split run scales like
`beta ^ depth * worldFuel'`, and depth is not bounded by anything proved in that file -- this is,
in its own words, "a real property of a deliberate engine policy, not a gap in a proof," of the
same class as the already-settled `buildTableau_isSome` refutation. If, in the course of this
task's approved route (b) work, the split-arm fuel-adequacy question proves genuinely unclosable
as specified -- i.e. no depth bound can be established or supplied without weakening the engine's
own proportional-fuel policy -- the correct deliverable is an explicit ASSESS-and-C9-register
outcome: name the specific obstruction, add a C9 register entry (in
`Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean`, alongside its other entries) stating precisely which
theorem still carries the split-arm scaling exposure and under what hypothesis, and stop there.
This is a VALID, COMPLETE outcome for this sub-question -- do not treat "close it" as the only
acceptable result, and do not force a proof past this obstruction by weakening `NoSplit`,
reintroducing a hypothesis this task's own do-not-re-attempt register forbids, or narrowing a
statement into vacuity.

### 412. Prove refutation core and decidability of provability with completeness corollaries
- **Effort**: 10-15 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 165, Task 410, Task 411, Task 428, Task 430

**Description**: Track B finish for the TM tableau decidability program (parent: task 165; grounding: reports/02_tableau-decidability-hard-research.md sections 3.1, 8.3, 8.5). Create Verified/Refutation/Core.lean proving allClosed_derivable as ONE induction over allRulesForFC fc, discharging each rule by its admissibility lemma (predecessor tasks) and its ruleFrameClass r <= fc hypothesis via the RuleSpec GATE lemmas — Dense/Discrete/Dedekind instantiate the generic theorem, they do not re-prove it. Then Verified/Provable.lean: Decidable (Derivable fc [] phi) combining allClosed_derivable with Track A's buildTableau_isSome and not_valid_of_hasOpen; the completeness corollaries ValidFor fc phi -> Derivable fc [] phi; supply the Dedekind engine consumed by completeness_dedekind_of_engine (StrongCompleteness.lean:308, target ValidDedekindDense). Acceptance: zero sorries repo-wide outside Boneyard; lake build green; update typst/latex decidability chapters to record headline result 2.
RE-SCOPING ADDENDUM (2026-07-29, supersedes the buildTableau_isSome reference above): the scope text above depends on "Track A's buildTableau_isSome", which task 165 proved FALSE and placed on a do-not-re-attempt register (165's plan 01_tableau-decidability-two-track.md:1405-1420, :1489-1493). The refutation is a property of the engine signature, not a proof difficulty: buildTableau returns none whenever a formula explores more than maxBranches := 50000, at ANY fuel. Consequently this task's acceptance criterion "zero sorries repo-wide outside Boneyard" was UNREACHABLE AS SCOPED, independently of task 165's own status.

CORRECTED DEPENDENCE: consume the budget-parameterised totality theorem from task 428 (engine_totality_at_a_quantified_branch_budget) -- shape `buildTableau_isSome_of_budget phi fc maxBranches (hmb : <bound in phi> <= maxBranches)` -- in place of the unconditional buildTableau_isSome. Task 428 has been added as a predecessor. Do NOT attempt the unconditional form yourself.

ALSO NOTE: this task inherits obstructions O2 and O3 (the boxAnchoredCheck and temporalWitnessCheck truth-lemma side conditions) from Phase 7.3 of task 165 by way of not_valid_of_hasOpen. Those are owned by task 429. If your induction reaches a point where a truth-lemma gate hypothesis must be discharged on real engine output, that is 429's work, not this task's -- record it and coordinate rather than re-deriving it. Grounding for all of this: specs/165_establish_semantic_finite_model_property/reports/09_phase7-deadlock-blocker-research.md.

REALIGNMENT CORRECTION (task 468, 2026-08-25): the struck clause above ("discharge the
pre-existing sorry countermodel_discrete at Transfer.lean:1242") is STALE. That sorry no longer
exists -- countermodel_discrete is CLOSED, via tasks 477/478/479's k-equivalence/groupable-
companion route, and now lives sorry-free in
FormalSystem/Metalogic/WeakCanonical/GroupModel/CountermodelBase.lean, not Transfer.lean. Verified
fresh by scripts/check-module-invariants.sh C2/C3 at realignment time: C3 reports zero live
structural sorries tree-wide; C2 reports BXCanonical.completeness axiom-clean
([propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]). This task's remaining scope (allClosed_derivable, the
Decidable (Derivable fc [] phi) instance, the completeness corollaries, the Dedekind engine) is
UNCHANGED and still open.

New task 482 (discharge_proof_extraction_completeness, dependencies: [412]) is the owner of
eliminating .extractionFailed as a live outcome on a genuinely closed tableau -- it is gated on
this task's allClosed_derivable induction as a prerequisite and consumes it once landed. This
task's own acceptance criteria are unchanged by 482's existence; 482 is a downstream consumer,
not an addition to this task's scope.

### 411. Prove hard admissibility lemmas for until since trichotomy discrete and dedekind rules
- **Effort**: 15-20 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: decidability
- **Dependencies**: Task 165, Task 410

**Description**: Track B part 2 for the TM tableau decidability program (parent: task 165; grounding: reports/02_tableau-decidability-hard-research.md sections 3.2-3.3 and 10). First run a /literature acquisition pass for Reynolds 1992 and Reynolds 2003 (the untlNeg co-decomposition and the Dedekind gap axioms; report 02 section 10 flags in-repo literature as thin). Then prove the hard admissibility block in Verified/Refutation/Rules/{UntilSince,Trichotomy,Discrete,Dense,Dedekind}.lean: untlPos (branch 1 via until_F, branch 2 via self_accum_until — follow the axiom literally), untlNeg (Reynolds co-decomposition via absorb_until + left_mono_until_G; the single largest lemma — budget it its own dispatch), sncePos/snceNeg duals, orderTrichotomy (one-liner if Phase 2.2 kept branches syntactically equal to temp_linearity disjuncts — verify, do not assume), z1Rule (two-premise instance of z1 + two modus ponens, relies on same-label internalization from the predecessor task), densityRule/denseIndicatorClosure via density/dense_indicator, and the Dedekind rules via prior_U_gap/prior_S_gap/sep. Acceptance: all admissibility lemmas sorry-free; lake build green.

### 410. Internalize tableau branches and prove routine rule admissibility

- **Plan**: [410_internalize_tableau_branches_and_prove_routine_rule_admissibility/plans/01_internalize-routine-admissibility.md]

**Description**: Track B part 1 for the TM tableau decidability program (parent: task 165, plan plans/01_tableau-decidability-two-track.md, research reports/02_tableau-decidability-hard-research.md sections 3.1-3.4). Create FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Internalize.lean defining Branch.internalize (world labels via box/diamond nesting, time labels via U/S guards realizing the branch TimeOrdering; SETTLED constraints: internalization design over substitution — no cut or uniform-substitution admissibility exists in the tree — and z1Rule's two premises must stay at the same label). Then prove the routine admissibility lemmas in Verified/Refutation/Rules/{Propositional,Modal,Temporal}.lean (~21 lemmas: 8 propositional, 4 S5 modal, 1 boxTemporal, 8 temporal universal/existential), each stated as rule_admissible per report 02 section 3.1 with hypothesis ruleFrameClass r <= fc, reusing Combinators.lean, ModalS5.lean, TemporalDerived.lean, GeneralizedNecessitation.lean, and DeductionTheorem.lean via DerivationTree.lift. Acceptance: all lemmas sorry-free, lake build green, RuleSpec GATE lemmas still green.

### 298. Fix c7 labeling bug and regenerate dataset
- **Status**: [PARTIAL]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement

  - [298_fix_c7_labeling_bug_and_regenerate_dataset/summaries/01_c7-labeling-bug-summary.md]

**Description**: Fix c7 labeling bug at formula ~13750 that causes unbounded memory growth in the decision procedure's timeout handling, then regenerate the full c7 dataset. During task 297 dataset regeneration, all 3 attempts to generate c7 stalled at exactly record 13,749 with RSS growing ~40MB/6s. The labeling function enters an apparent infinite loop or unbounded search for formula #13,750 in the sorted enumeration order. The timeout mechanism either does not fire or cannot interrupt the stuck state. Steps: (1) Identify the specific formula at position ~13,750 in the c7 enumeration. (2) Reproduce the hang in isolation with that formula. (3) Diagnose whether the decision procedure's timeout is failing to fire or the procedure is in an uninterruptible state. (4) Fix the timeout handling so it reliably terminates. (5) Regenerate the full c7 dataset (target: 77,272 records)

### 296. Re add derived binary operators with dedup fix
- **Status**: [PARTIAL]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Task 295, Task 298
- **Research**: [296_re_add_derived_binary_operators_with_dedup_fix/reports/01_derived-binary-operators.md]
- **Plan**: [296_re_add_derived_binary_operators_with_dedup_fix/plans/01_derived-binary-operators-plan.md]
- **Summary**: [296_re_add_derived_binary_operators_with_dedup_fix/summaries/01_derived-binary-operators-summary.md]

**Description**: Re-add the 6 derived binary temporal operators (release, weak_until, trigger, weak_since, strong_release, strong_trigger) to the formula enumerator, adjusting canonicalization and/or the passesFilter gate so they survive deduplication and appear in the unique pipeline output. These operators were removed in task 295 because they inflated the enumeration space by ~40-60% without contributing unique formulas — their canonical representations collapsed with primitives. Potential approaches: (1) skip canonicalization for formulas containing derived binary operators, (2) canonicalize to the derived form instead of the primitive form, (3) lower or remove the passesFilter complexity gate for these operators, (4) add a fold-aware dedup stage that treats release(p,q) as distinct from neg(untl(neg p, neg q)). The goal is to have all 13 derived operators represented in the final dataset.

### 282. Exhaustive enumeration by default
- **Status**: [PARTIAL]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Task 274, Task 298

- **Summary**: [282_exhaustive_enumeration_by_default/summaries/01_exhaustive-enumeration-summary.md]

**Description**: Flip complexity-9 dataset generation from stratified to exhaustive-by-default once feasibility is confirmed. Prior work (see plans/01_exhaustive-enumeration-plan.md, handoffs/phase-1-6-handoff-20260714.md) verified the 0-sentinel/.take-guard machinery is already correct and unlimited-capable, and corrected stale infeasibility claims in data/README.md and scripts/run_dataset_generation.sh. The next action is the deferred c9 feasibility probe (Plan Phase 2), followed -- pending a GO verdict and explicit user approval for the multi-hour compute -- by c8/c9 exhaustive regeneration and HF Hub republication (Phases 3, 4(rest), 5, 6(rest), 7).

### 257. Large data storage huggingface
- **Status**: [BLOCKED]
- **Task Type**: general
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [257_large_data_storage_huggingface/reports/01_large-data-storage.md]
- **Plan**: [257_large_data_storage_huggingface/plans/01_implementation-plan.md]
- **Summary**: [257_large_data_storage_huggingface/summaries/01_execution-summary.md]

**Description**: Complete the Hugging Face Hub migration for large dataset storage. Prior work (see plans/01_implementation-plan.md, summaries/01_execution-summary.md) removed Git LFS tracking from .gitattributes and rewrote data/README.md to point at HF Hub (logos-labs/bmlogic-bench) as the canonical source, but Phase 1 -- the actual upload to HF Hub via the existing data/hf-dataset/upload.py pipeline -- was never executed because it requires user HF authentication. This task is blocked on that credential; once supplied, run the upload, validate, and confirm data/hf-dataset/PUBLISHING.md's 'Migration Status' header reflects completion.

### 231. Dataset regeneration automation
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: general
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Task 230, Task 298

**Description**: Build comprehensive automation so that every dataset regeneration automatically updates all downstream artifacts and documentation fields. Supersedes task 227 scope. (1) Create data/scripts/sync-all.py master sync script that: (a) Scans all JSONL files and recomputes metadata JSON files (record counts, rule distributions, schema field lists, valid/invalid ratios, tier distributions, step statistics). (b) Updates specific fields in data/README.md: file inventory table (Records, Size columns), training record schema table (field count), proof steps statistics (records, theorems, rule distribution, steps per theorem), cross-logic split table (records, valid rates), NL paraphrase statistics. (c) Updates specific fields in data/dataset-card.md: overview table, all record counts, proof steps section, competitive position 'primary gaps' paragraph. (d) Recomputes SHA-256 hashes and contentSize for all distributions in croissant.json. (e) Regenerates bmlogic-bench-splits.json. (f) Validates all JSONL records against declared schemas (checks field presence, types, null patterns). (g) Checks train/benchmark formula overlap and reports contamination percentage. (h) Validates metadata key consistency (total_records not total_count). (2) Idempotent and safe to run after any regeneration command (lake exe dataset_generator, lake exe proof_extractor, lake exe benchmark_oracle, finalize_benchmark.py). (3) --dry-run mode that reports what would change. (4) --commit mode that creates structured git commit. (5) CI-friendly exit codes (0=clean, 1=staleness detected, 2=validation error). (6) Update data/README.md with pipeline documentation. (7) Integrate into agent context (.claude/context/project/dataset/) so /implement for dataset tasks runs sync-all as post-implementation step. Note: supersedes task 227 (dataset_pipeline_automation_croissant_sync) with broader scope covering README/dataset-card field updates and schema validation.
=== ITEM (7) TARGETS A DISPOSABLE DEPLOY ARTIFACT -- CORRECTED 2026-08-24 ===

Item (7) above says "Integrate into agent context (.claude/context/project/dataset/)". DO NOT WRITE
THERE. Verified 2026-08-24: `.claude/` in this repository is fully gitignored (`.gitignore:81`) with
zero tracked files, and is regenerated wholesale from a source store that is NOT in this repository
-- it lives at /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/agent-system/, a separate git repo. A file written to
`.claude/context/project/dataset/` will be silently destroyed on the user's next agent-system
reload.

Item (7) therefore CANNOT be completed from inside this repository. Two acceptable dispositions,
both of which require asking the user first:

  (a) DROP item (7) from this task's scope and record why. The other seven sub-targets of this task
      are ordinary repository work (`data/scripts/sync-all.py`, `data/README.md`,
      `data/dataset-card.md`, `croissant.json`, the splits file, schema validation, contamination
      check) and are unaffected. This is the recommended default -- it keeps the task in one repo.
  (b) Split item (7) into a task filed in the nvim repository's own tracker
      (/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/specs/state.json), targeting
      agent-system/extensions/<appropriate-extension>/context/, and committed there.

Do not silently satisfy item (7) by writing into `.claude/`.
=== ITEM (7) DROPPED FROM SCOPE -- 2026-08-24, user decision ===

Item (7) ("Integrate into agent context (.claude/context/project/dataset/) so /implement for
dataset tasks runs sync-all as post-implementation step") is REMOVED from this task's scope. It is
not a defect and not deferred -- it is out of scope here, permanently, and no successor task owns
it in this repository.

WHY. The disposition options recorded above were put to the user on 2026-08-24 and option (a) was
chosen. Three considerations decided it:

  1. `.claude/` here is gitignored (`.gitignore:81`, zero tracked files) and regenerated wholesale
     from /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/agent-system/, a separate git repo. A file written to
     `.claude/context/project/dataset/` is destroyed on the next agent-system reload.
  2. Filing it in the nvim tracker instead was considered and declined. There is no `dataset`
     extension in that source store (verified 2026-08-24: core, cslib, email, epidemiology,
     filetypes, formal, founder, latex, lean, literature, memory, nix, nvim, present, python,
     slidev, typst, web, z3), and a BimodalLogic-specific post-implementation hook placed in the
     shared global agent-system would deploy to every repository that loads it. It would have to be
     generalized into a repo-local hook mechanism first -- a different and larger piece of work
     than this task.
  3. The `.syncprotect` escape hatch (project root; honored by deploy-headless.sh and the picker's
     sync path) would survive a reload, but leaves the file untracked and unbacked-up in a repo
     where everything else is version-controlled.

WHAT REMAINS IN SCOPE. Items (1) through (6) and (8), unchanged and unaffected -- they are ordinary
repository work under `data/`: `data/scripts/sync-all.py`, `data/README.md`,
`data/dataset-card.md`, `croissant.json`, `bmlogic-bench-splits.json`, schema validation, the
train/benchmark contamination check, and the metadata-key consistency check. Do not treat the
removal of item (7) as reducing any of them.

IF THE HOOK IS WANTED LATER. `sync-all.py` is a plain script with CI-friendly exit codes (item 5).
Wire it from repository CI or run it manually after a regeneration. That reaches the same outcome
without depending on agent-system context at all.

### 219. Llm baseline difficulty calibration
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Task Type**: general
- **Topic**: dataset-enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Task 231
- **Research**: [219_llm_baseline_difficulty_calibration/reports/01_llm-baseline-research.md]

**Description**: Run bmlogic-bench through multiple LLMs to establish baseline difficulty calibration. Evaluate at least 3 models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, a 7B open model). Report zero-shot accuracy per difficulty tier (easy/medium/hard/very_hard), chain-of-thought vs direct label accuracy, error rate correlation with modal/temporal depth. Include random baseline (50% for balanced benchmark). Publish results in data/baselines/README.md with methodology. Both symbolic formula input and NL paraphrase input (if available from R1).

### 193. Codebase tactic refactor
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: automation
- **Dependencies**: Task 165, Task 402, Task 448, Task 470
- **Research**: [193_codebase_tactic_refactor/reports/01_codebase-refactor-seed.md]

**Description**: Apply validity-intro and truth-simp macros to the soundness layer.

RE-SCOPED 2026-07-26 by the codebase tactic survey (now archived at specs/archive/196_codebase_tactic_survey/reports/02_automation-survey.md section 6.3). The original charter targeted Theorems/ using tm_prove. Theorems/ is 7,017 lines - 3.8% of the tree, half the relative share the 2026-05 research assumed - and is sorry-free and stable; tm_prove (task 192) is abandoned; and the search-family tactics it would have fallen back on have zero adoption. The task keeps its kind (an application pass that reduces existing proof text) and replaces its target and its instrument.

Define a small family of syntactic macros and apply them mechanically to the three files that concentrate the codebase two highest-frequency verbatim proof repetitions. This is an APPLICATION task: the deliverable is measured reduction in existing proof text at named files, not the existence of a macro.

Macros to define (single-line `macro ... : tactic` declarations - no elaboration, no goal inspection):
  - intros_validity           for `intro F M Omega _h_sc τ _h_mem t`
  - intros_validity_framed    for the frame-condition-prefixed variant
  - simp_truth                for the recurring `simp only [TruthAt, Truth.future_iff, Truth.past_iff, Truth.some_future_iff, Truth.some_past_iff]` bundle
  - unfold_validity           composing intros_validity with simp_truth, for sites where the two appear consecutively

NAMING NOTE (2026-07-27): the simp head symbol is `TruthAt`, not the pre-upgrade `truth_at` -- the systematic Mathlib naming upgrade renamed it. The `Truth.*_iff` names above are unchanged (declared in FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean at :220 some_future_iff, :239 some_past_iff, :258 future_iff, :278 past_iff).

Measured target sites (re-verified 2026-07-27 against the working tree, Boneyard/ excluded; counts unchanged from the 2026-07-26 measurement, only the paths and the simp head symbol were restated):
  - FormalSystem/Metalogic/SoundnessLemmas/DenseValidity.lean      - 92 `intro F M Omega`, 54 `simp only [TruthAt`
  - FormalSystem/Metalogic/SoundnessLemmas/FrameClassVariants.lean - 56 `intro F M Omega`, 30 `simp only [TruthAt`
  - FormalSystem/Metalogic/Soundness.lean                          -  0 `intro F M Omega`, 47 `simp only [TruthAt`

DO BOTH MACRO GROUPS AS ONE PASS over the same files, not two. Splitting them edits the same two files twice and forfeits the unfold_validity collapse.

COMPLETION CRITERION: `intro F M Omega` occurrences in the two SoundnessLemmas/ files reach zero; `simp only [TruthAt` occurrences across the three files fall by at least 80%; lake build green; executable sorry count unchanged at 1, located BY CONTENT in FormalSystem/Metalogic/WeakCanonical/Transfer.lean, never by line number. A task that ends with working macros and unchanged proof text has FAILED.

EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE: Theorems/ refactoring, tm_prove, modal_search and every other search-family tactic, and any new elaborated tactic. See the survey report section 5 for the measured evidence (38 real proof-site invocations across ~5,800 lines of proof automation, all 38 in one file).

DEPENDENCY ON THE SYSTEMATIC MATHLIB NAMING UPGRADE -- NOW DISCHARGED (2026-07-27): this task rewrites proof bodies at roughly 330 sites, and the naming-upgrade task rewrote the same reference graph at 24,364 sites while moving every file from Theories/Bimodal/ to FormalSystem/. A mass proof rewrite must not race a mass rename, so this task was held until that rename landed. It HAS landed -- the naming-upgrade task is status `completed` -- so the precondition is satisfied and this task is NOT blocked. Every path in this description, and every entry in file_scope, is now stated in its post-rename FormalSystem/ form; `Theories/Bimodal/` appears above only as the historical source of that move, never as a path to open.

Inventory groups drawn on: survey report section 4.2 groups 2 (intros_validity, score 153) and 3 (simp_truth, score 72.7).

### 178. Publication examples and demo
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: formula-refactor
- **Dependencies**: Task 131, Task 193, Task 402

**Description**: Expand Examples/ with publication-quality demonstrations of the full verified pipeline. Complete worked example showing soundness and completeness on a concrete formula, plus decidability of the propositional fragment (genuinely complete today, per the soundness/completeness metatheory's axiom-clean status). Examples exercising each frame class with FrameClass-parameterized DerivationTree. Examples of the expressive completeness result. Update BimodalProofs.lean and TemporalStructures.lean. All examples sorry-free.

REALIGNMENT CORRECTION (task 468, 2026-08-25, carried from specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md
amendment M-7, independently re-confirmed at realignment time): the struck original acceptance
criterion above ("Complete worked example showing soundness-completeness-decidability on a
concrete formula") is RESCOPED. Decidability of TM (the full bimodal logic) is still open --
re-confirmed fresh this dispatch: grep -rn "isValid" FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/ shows no
declaration takes DecisionProcedure.isValid as its subject, and ruleSound_of_mem_allRulesForFC is
not lifted to any allClosed -> valid theorem. `truthAt_of_isValid`
(Verified/Decidable.lean:2412) is NOT evidence of decidability -- it concerns a different,
semantic-side `SoundnessLemmas.IsValid`, not the decision procedure's `DecisionProcedure.isValid`.
Do not cite it as such. This task's decidability example is therefore rescoped to the
propositional-fragment case (genuinely decidable today) rather than the full logic; a full-logic
decidability example remains gated on the decidability/tableau front (410-465,
480-482) landing.

### 177. Update readme and module docstrings
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: formula-refactor
- **Dependencies**: Task 131, Task 193, Task 402, Task 426, Task 428, Task 429, Task 430, Task 432, Task 433, Task 434, Task 440, Task 441, Task 448

**Description**: Update README.md, docs/, and FormalSystem/ module-level docstrings to their final post-refactor state, once the decidability chain (426, 428, 429, 430, 432, 433, 434) lands. This is the final polish pass, distinct from and run after task 472's already-completed immediate correction pass. Explicitly excludes: every item task 472 already corrected (the Decidability.lean Status block, Verified/README.md, FMP/README.md, DecisionProcedure.lean's decideAuto docstring, Verified/Decidable.lean's Status docstring, WeakCanonical.lean, RealModel/ShuffleReal.lean, Soundness.lean, PriorExpressivenessDense.lean) and the two Kamp files task 473 already swept (Kamp/EANegationClosure.lean, NfMultiAnchorBridge/NavigatedSpine.lean). This task's residual content is: re-auditing all touched documentation for drift accumulated during the decidability chain's landing (472/473 audited a snapshot; the chain's remaining tasks will touch further files after 472/473 ran), and the Axiom Reference update the charter names as part of 177's original scope.

REALIGNMENT NOTE (task 468, 2026-08-25, verdict per specs/468_realign_task_programme_from_proof_state_audit/reports/02_stage1-verification-and-programme-realignment.md §6): DIVIDE, already half-executed exactly as specs/reviews/review-2026-08-24.md amendment 10f states -- tasks 472 (documentation correction pass) and 473 (Kamp vacuity deletion) already ran the ungated half; the description above is the remaining, gated half's text. `file_scope` (README.md, specs/ROADMAP.md, FormalSystem/, docs/) was already repaired by task 470 item (G) and is confirmed resolvable, no duplicate -- left unchanged here.

### 128. Open set operator dense continuous
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: frame-extensions
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Add topological open set (interior) operator for dense and continuous temporal frames. On discrete ℤ the interior is trivial (discrete topology), but on dense ℚ and continuous ℝ it captures neighborhood-stable truth: Int(φ) true at t iff φ holds in an open neighborhood of t. Related to Dynamic Topological Logic (Kremer-Mints 2005), McKinsey-Tarski topological semantics for S4, and Fernandez-Duque intuitionistic temporal logic. Phase 1: add TopologicalSpace instance to TaskFrame for dense/continuous cases. Phase 2: add interior constructor to Formula with truth clause. Phase 3: axioms (S4-like: Int(φ)→φ, Int(φ)→Int(Int(φ))). Phase 4: interaction with temporal operators and S5 □. Note: DTL is not finitely axiomatizable (Fernandez-Duque 2014) — completeness may require non-standard techniques.

### 127. Time addition operator
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: lean4
- **Topic**: frame-extensions
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Add time addition operator (+) to the bimodal logic TM. φ + ψ is true at (τ, x) iff ∃ y,z with x = y+z, φ true at (τ,y), ψ true at (τ,z). This internalizes the AddCommGroup structure of D into the object language, extending expressive power from FO[<] to FO[<,+] (Presburger arithmetic). Related to arrow logic (Venema), relevant logic (Routley-Meyer ternary frames), and separation logic (BI). Phase 1: add tadd/tsub constructors to Formula, truth clause in semantics. Phase 2: basic axioms (associativity, commutativity, identity, inverse). Phase 3: soundness proofs. Phase 4: interaction with G/H/U/S/□. Completeness (ternary canonical model) and decidability are open research problems — defer to later phases.

### 125. Jonsson tarski representation bimodal sus
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: formal
- **Topic**: algebraic-representation
- **Dependencies**: Task 420, Task 439, Task 461, Task 498, Task 499

**Description**: CAPSTONE of the algebraic representation front. Prove the Jonsson-Tarski representation theorem for the bimodal logic: the embedding eta(a) = {U | a in U} is an injective STSA homomorphism A -> Cm(Uf(A)).

RE-SCOPED. This task's original four phases are now distributed: Phase 1 (complex algebra Cm(F)) and Phase 2 (ultrafilter frame Uf(A), including the Spherical obligation) are separately tasked and are this task's dependencies; Phase 4 (binary untl/snce operators) is separately tasked and depends on this one. What remains here is Phase 3 -- the embedding itself and its injectivity -- stated at the unary signature (box, G, H, sigma).

PREREQUISITE STATE, RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-26: the STSA class and the R_G/R_H/R_Box ultrafilter frame exist as Boneyard seeds behind #exit and are ported by the dependency tasks. The MCS-to-ultrafilter bijection is live at Algebraic/UltrafilterMCS.lean:782 (ultrafilter_correspondence), though stated existentially rather than as a named Equiv -- converting it to an Equiv may be worth doing here. The BooleanAlgebra LindenbaumAlg instance is at BooleanStructure.lean:421.

THE PRIOR PREREQUISITE LIST IN THIS DESCRIPTION IS STALE and is superseded: it named 'resolve 6 algebraic sorries in TenseS5Algebra/InteriorOperators/LindenbaumQuotient'. InteriorOperators.lean and LindenbaumQuotient.lean are sorry-free today; the remaining sorries are the 3 in the Boneyard TenseS5Algebra seed, and they are for REMOVED axioms (temp_a, temp_l) that must be restated against the current 45-constructor axiom set rather than proved as-is. That is the STSA port task's business, not this one's.

LITERATURE: Goldblatt 1989 'Varieties of complex algebras' (APAL 44, 173-242, doi 10.1016/0168-0072(89)90032-8) has been acquired. CAVEAT THAT MUST BE HONORED: the acquired PDF is an Acrobat 3.0 Capture scan with a badly degraded OCR text layer -- math-heavy pages yield mangled symbols, dropped and reordered lines. READ THE PAGE IMAGES DIRECTLY (the Read tool's pages parameter); do NOT rely on a pdftotext-derived conversion for any axiom statement or equation. Blackburn/de Rijke/Venema 2002 Chapter 5 (corpus entry blackburn_2002) is the primary reference and is born-digital.

MATHLIB HOOK: Order/Atoms.lean:710 (toSetOfIsAtom : alpha <-> Set {a // IsAtom a} for CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra) is the atom-structure half of Stone/Jonsson-Tarski for the complete atomic case and is the single most relevant Mathlib lemma here; supporting lemma eq_setOf_le_sSup_and_isAtom at :695. Mathlib has NO Stone duality for Boolean algebras and no BAO machinery -- the rest is greenfield.

SEE ALSO the reconciliation task on whether this embedding can be factored through ShiftSet.lean's reverse_repr rather than built independently; if it can, that supersedes part of this task's construction and this description should be revised again before implementation starts.
