## The Completeness Gap (Priority 1)

### Architecture

```
⊬ φ → (Lindenbaum) → MCS M₀ ∋ φ.neg
     → (SuccChain) → FMCS family over Int        ← BLOCKED HERE
     → (Truth Lemma) → φ false at canonical model
     → ¬valid φ
```

The algebraic path (`Algebraic/ParametricRepresentation.lean`) is **sorry-free** through the
conditional representation theorem, but requires a `construct_bfmcs` callback that the
SuccChain construction is trying to provide.

### The Two Classes of Sorry

#### Class A: Solvable via MCS Double-Negation Elimination

**Sorries at SuccChainFMCS.lean:2359, 3011** — "Modal duality derivation"

These are blocked by the comment: "Formula.neg is φ.imp bot, so some_future and
all_future are NOT syntactic duals." But this is misleading — they ARE definitionally
equal via `rfl`:

```
F(ψ) = some_future(ψ) = ψ.neg.all_future.neg = neg(G(neg(ψ)))    -- rfl
```

Therefore:
```
neg(FF(ψ)) = neg(neg(G(neg(F(ψ)))))
```

And `SetMaximalConsistent.double_neg_elim` (TemporalCoherence.lean:124) gives:
```
neg(neg(X)) ∈ M → X ∈ M    -- for any MCS M
```

**Proof sketch for sorry at 2359**:
1. `FF(ψ) ∈ deferralClosure` and `FF(ψ) ∉ u` (given)
2. By negation completeness of restricted MCS: `neg(FF(ψ)) ∈ u`
3. `neg(FF(ψ)) = neg(neg(G(neg(F(ψ)))))` (definitional, since `FF(ψ) = neg(G(neg(F(ψ))))`)
4. By `double_neg_elim`: `G(neg(F(ψ))) ∈ u`
5. So `neg(F(ψ)) ∈ g_content(u)`
6. By Succ relation: `neg(F(ψ)) ∈ v`
7. From F-step: `ψ ∈ v ∨ F(ψ) ∈ v`
8. `F(ψ) ∉ v` (by MCS consistency with `neg(F(ψ)) ∈ v`)
9. Therefore `ψ ∈ v` ∎

**Estimated effort**: Small. All ingredients exist in the codebase.

#### Class B: Genuinely Hard — Boundary Cases at Deferral Closure Edge

**Status: RESOLVED via bidirectional witness approach** (see "Temporal Coherence Resolution" below)

**Sorries at SuccChainFMCS.lean:2979, 3025, 3096, 3675, 3903, 3915**

These arise when `FF(ψ) ∉ deferralClosure(φ)` (the target formula's closure). In this case:
- Negation completeness doesn't apply (formula outside the closure)
- We cannot derive `neg(FF(ψ)) ∈ u`
- The DNE argument from Class A breaks down
- The F-step may defer: `ψ ∈ v ∨ F(ψ) ∈ v`, and we can't rule out `F(ψ) ∈ v`

**Root issue**: The theorem `restricted_single_step_forcing` claims `ψ ∈ v` (at the
very next step), but when the F-obligation falls outside the closure, it may defer to
a later step. The claim may be **too strong** — the correct statement might be
"ψ eventually appears within the chain" rather than "ψ appears at step k+1."

**Resolution**: The bidirectional temporal witness approach (task 70, plan v4) bypasses
these issues entirely by using a simpler seed that preserves both G and H theories.
See "Temporal Coherence Resolution" section below for details.

### Algebraic Perspective

The algebraic path (`Algebraic/`) provides sorry-free infrastructure:

```
LindenbaumQuotient → BooleanStructure → InteriorOperators
         → UltrafilterMCS → ParametricCanonical → ParametricTruthLemma
         → ParametricRepresentation (SORRY-FREE, conditional)
```

The gap is `construct_bfmcs`: given MCS M₀, produce a temporally coherent BFMCS.

#### Modal Completeness (Box Forward/Backward) — SOLVED

The **modal direction is complete**. `boxClassFamilies_modal_backward` (UltrafilterChain.lean:1678)
proves modal backward for the `boxClassFamilies` bundle construction. This theorem is sorry-free
and uses the contraposition argument:

1. If Box(phi) not in MCS, then Diamond(neg phi) in M0
2. `box_theory_witness_exists` provides W' with neg(phi) in W' and same box-class
3. The shifted chain from W' is in the bundle
4. If phi were in ALL families, it would be in W', contradiction

The `parametric_canonical_truth_lemma` (ParametricTruthLemma.lean:170) uses `B.modal_backward`
at line 269, which is populated by `boxClassFamilies_modal_backward` when constructing
via `construct_bfmcs`.

**Status**: Modal completeness (Box case) has no sorries. The remaining challenge is
**temporal coherence** (G/H backward), which requires the SuccChain or per-obligation
witness architecture work described above.

**Algebraic insight**: The SuccChain approach tries to build the FMCS by explicit
forward/backward enumeration. The algebraic approach could instead:

1. Take the Lindenbaum algebra `L = Formula / ≡`
2. The temporal operators G, H are interior operators on L (proven)
3. Ultrafilters of L correspond to MCSs (proven)
4. Define `mcs(t)` for each `t : D` using the **algebraic temporal shift**:
   an automorphism of L induced by temporal translation
5. The FMCS coherence conditions follow from algebraic properties

This avoids the F-nesting boundary entirely because the algebraic construction
doesn't enumerate F-obligations — it works at the level of the entire algebra.

**Key question**: Can the temporal shift automorphism be defined on the Lindenbaum
algebra? The G operator is deflationary (`G[φ] ≤ [φ]`), monotone, and idempotent.
If G determines a topology on L whose open sets are G-closed, then temporal
accessibility is a preorder on ultrafilters, and the FMCS construction is the
Stone-space unraveling.

## Temporal Coherence Resolution (March 2026)

### Dead Ends (Archived)

1. **CoherentZChain** (UltrafilterChain.lean ~7286-7496): Fundamentally broken. Forward chain
   preserves G but not H; backward chain preserves H but not G. Cross-direction coherence
   requires preserving both, which this architecture cannot support. 6 unfixable sorries.

2. **`f_preserving_seed_consistent` sub-case A** (lines 3363-3369): Mathematically unprovable.
   The deduction argument produces `G(phi) -> G(neg psi)` in M, but `G(phi)` not in M means
   the implication is vacuously true, yielding no contradiction. The semantic reason:
   "eventually phi AND eventually psi" is consistent when psi holds BEFORE phi.

3. **`omega_true_dovetailed_forward_F_resolution`** (line ~7696): Unfixable sorry in the
   "F(phi) vanishes" case. The Lindenbaum extension can add `G(neg phi)` when consistent
   with the seed, even when `F(phi)` was present earlier.

4. **Bundle-level temporal coherence**: Insufficient for truth lemma. G/H operators are
   intrinsically single-history; a witness in a different family uses a different history,
   invalidating the semantic argument for `temporal_backward_G`.

6. **Fuel-based bounded witness recursion** (tasks 48, 67, 81 plan v13): Repeatedly attempted
   and failed. The approach adds an explicit fuel parameter bounded by `closure_F_bound` to
   the witness recursion and tries to prove the fuel=0 branch is unreachable. **Fundamental
   flaw**: fuel conflates F-nesting depth (bounded) with persistence count (unbounded). In the
   `inr` (persistence) case, the same F-formula can persist through arbitrarily many chain
   steps without reducing depth, exhausting fuel while depth remains positive. Variants tried:
   - Task 48 plan v5: Single fuel bounded by `closure_F_bound(phi)` — fuel exhaustion at
     positive depth with no contradiction derivable
   - Task 67 summaries 11-12: Two-fuel variant (resolve_fuel + defer_fuel) — invariant
     preservation fails at recursive call sites
   - Task 81 plan v13: Fuel `B*B+1` — same structural problem, persistence is not bounded by
     depth. See `specs/081_.../reports/14_fuel-approach-review.md` for full analysis.

5. **Bidirectional Temporal Witness (plan v4)**: BLOCKED. The seed construction
   `bidirectional_temporal_box_seed = G_theory ∪ H_theory ∪ box_theory` requires that ALL
   seed elements be G-liftable for the consistency proof. H_theory elements are NOT
   G-liftable: `H(a) -> G(H(a))` is NOT derivable in TM logic. See report 10 (blocker-analysis.md).

### Working Approach: Separate-Direction Witnesses (SuccChainFMCS)

**Key insight**: Don't try to combine F-witness and P-witness at the seed level.
Use separate constructions and achieve cross-direction coherence at CHAIN level.

**Implementation** (SuccChainFMCS.lean):
- Forward witnesses use `temporal_box_seed` (G_theory + box_theory) - G-liftable, proven consistent
- Backward witnesses use `past_temporal_box_seed` (H_theory + box_theory) - H-liftable, proven consistent
- Cross-direction coherence achieved via Succ relation properties:
  - `Succ.g_persistence`: g_content(M) ⊆ M' (forward G propagation)
  - `Succ_implies_h_content_reverse`: h_content(M') ⊆ M (backward H propagation)

**Sorry-Free Properties**:
- `succ_chain_forward_G`: G(phi) at t implies phi at all t' > t
- `succ_chain_backward_H`: H(phi) at t implies phi at all t' < t
- `SuccChainFMCS`: FMCS structure with `forward_G` and `backward_H`

**Known Gaps (F/P Existential Witnesses)**:
- `forward_F`: F(phi) at t implies exists t' >= t with phi at t'
- `backward_P`: P(phi) at t implies exists t' <= t with phi at t'
- These have sorries due to unbounded F/P nesting in arbitrary MCS
- For sorry-free completeness, use `semantic_weak_completeness` (FMP path)

**Truth Lemma Connection** (SuccChainTruth.lean):
- G/H forward direction: Uses `succ_chain_forward_G_le`/`succ_chain_backward_H_le` - SORRY-FREE
- G/H backward direction: Uses `temporal_backward_G`/`temporal_backward_H` which require
  `forward_F`/`backward_P` - HAS SORRY
- Box backward direction: Requires modal saturation via BFMCS bundling - HAS SORRY

**Bidirectionality Constraint** (Task #71 documentation):
The truth lemma is INHERENTLY BIDIRECTIONAL - both directions are required for completeness.
The forward Imp case (`truth_lemma_forward_imp` at SuccChainTruth.lean:200) uses the
backward induction hypothesis via `.mpr`. Similarly, backward G/H cases require forward
witnesses (`forward_F`/`backward_P`). This constraint was discovered in task 70 when
proving that separate-direction witnesses (G/H only) are sorry-free while F/P gaps remain.

### Implementation Status

Task 70 plan v5 (`specs/070_explore_ultrafilter_construction/plans/05_separate-direction-witnesses.md`):
- Phase 0: Archive bidirectional construction - COMPLETED
- Phase 1-5: Verify Succ relation G/H properties - COMPLETED (already sorry-free)
- Phase 6: Connect to truth lemma - COMPLETED (documented in SuccChainFMCS.lean)
- Phase 7: Document F/P gaps - COMPLETED (this section)

## Investigated Dead Ends: Logic Weakening (Task 77)

**Conclusion**: Weakening TM by using a preorder (instead of linear order) for D does NOT
provide a viable path to completeness. The F/P witness blocker is independent of the order
structure on D.

### Key Findings

1. **Category Error**: Prior proposals that suggested "D = CanonicalMCS" conflated durations
   (D, an ordered abelian group) with world states (MCS). These are categorically distinct.

2. **Partial Order D Creates Multi-Dimensional Time**: If D is partially ordered (e.g., Z x Z),
   histories span 2D convex regions, not branching timelines. G(phi) becomes "phi in the entire
   future cone" - a fundamentally different temporal logic, not a natural weakening of TM.

3. **Only temp_linearity Requires Linearity**: All other TM axioms (MF, TF, temp_4, modal K, S5)
   work with preorder D. But dropping temp_linearity creates exotic semantics without solving
   the completeness challenge.

4. **F/P Blocker is Structural**: The blocker arises from omega-saturation in canonical model
   construction (unbounded F-obligations in a single coherent timeline), not from the order
   structure on D. Weakening D provides no advantage.

### Representation Theorem Goal

The goal of TM completeness is a **representation theorem** characterizing the frame class:

> "TM is complete with respect to TaskFrames over totally ordered abelian groups."

This tells us WHAT semantic class TM corresponds to. **Only the algebraic/canonical model
approach is to be pursued for completeness.** The canonical completeness approach (building a
single countermodel from MCS) is the unique path to representation theorems.

**FMP/filtration is NOT a substitute.** FMP proves decidability and finite model property but
does not provide frame class characterization. FMP work (task #998) is a separate decidability
track — it must not be conflated with, or used as a fallback for, the completeness theorem.
The F/P witness blocker is an open challenge on the canonical model path, not a reason to
retreat to FMP.
